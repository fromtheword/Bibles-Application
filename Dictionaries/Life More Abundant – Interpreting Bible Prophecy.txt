|||A prophetic Month||30 Prophetic days = 30 literal years (Rev 13:5)
|||A prophetic Year||360 Prophetic days = 360 literal years (12 x A biblical month)
|||Time||A term signifying 1 prophetic year = 360 prophetic days = 360 literal years (Daniel 4:16, 32,Rev 12:14); Jewish calendar year began ~March 22nd and ended the following March 21st
|||Times||A term denoting 2 prophetic years = 720 prophetic days = 720 literal years
|||Dividing [half] of time||A term denoting 1/2 of a prophetic year = 180 prophetic days = 180 literal years
|||Abel||Second son of Adam; foreshadowing the righteous through all generations who embrace God's free gift of salvation by grace through faith, the token of their faith being humble obedience. Abel's fate foreshadows the persecution the righteous will suffer at the hands of the wicked (Genesis 4:4; Galatians 4:28-30; Hebrews 11:4; 1 John 3:12; Hebrews 10:32, 33) [see Cain]
|||Abomination of Desolation||The Papal system, founded upon pagan beliefs and practices that promotes the exaltation of man over God; introduces man-made dogmas and worldly traditions over the Bible; exalts idolatry and pagan worship over pure Christianity [Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14; Revelation 14:7; James 1:27], seeks to change God's eternal 10 commandments [Daniel 7:8, 25; Exodus 20:1-17], and compels its self-professed moral and religious authority over all through the empowerment of the state forced and legislated morality] which the Bible deems the act of spiritual fornication. The man of sin who "opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God." John similarly describes this power as antichrist. (Matt 24:15; Luke 21:12; Mark 13:9; 2 Thessalonians 2:3-10; Daniel 7:24, 25; 9:27; Isaiah 42:8; 1 John 2:18, 22; Revelation 13:1-7). [see Shepherd (Idol); Beast (leopard-like); Transgression of Desolation; Fornication; Iron Mixed with Miry Clay; Paganism/Heathenism]
|||Abyss||See Bottomless Pit/Abyss
|||Ahab||Wicked and immoral king of Israel who thought it light to walk in the ways of Jeroboam, so he married Jezebel, the Phoenician princess, daughter of the High Priest of Baal. Wanting to purposely lead the people away from the worship of God, Ahab erected sanctuaries and shrines to every foreign god, until the Lord raised up the mighty prophet Elijah to stay Ahab's efforts (1 Kings 16:28-18:46). Prophetically in type, Ahab plays the role of the Dragon in the threefold power of Dragon, Beast and False Prophet [see Jezebel, Elijah (Elias); Dragon, Beast and False Prophet]
|||Alpha and Omega||The profession of God to be the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End of all things, which makes Him God, being the Creator of all things, having perfect clarity and insight to all mysteries. Jesus declares and requires the end from the beginning (Ecclesiastes 3:15), symbolizing that world events at the end of the world will mirror the former events. This principle is most important in understanding last day events as they relate to the Advent Movement's Alpha (beginning) and Omega(ending), as they will be paralleled (Isaiah 44:6-8, 42:9, 48:12; Revelation 1:8, 11; 21:6; 22:13)
|||Ammonites (Ammon)||Distant cousins to the Israelites, born of fornication/incest and perversion [son of Lot born of his daughter] (Genesis 19:1-38). The pagan god of the Ammonites was Molech whose image was that of an owl. The symbol of an owl is used today to denote education or wisdom and is therefore synonymous with "reason" [Adventist and Protestant Scholasticism]. Those who have knowledge of the true God but do not heed his commandments, pervert His truths, and are idolaters[spiritual fornicators] (Jeremiah 49:4). Never were the sons of Ammon or Moab to enter into the congregation of God because they thought to curse Israel (Nehemiah 13:1, 2; Jeremiah 49:1, 2; Ezekiel 25:1-7). [see Moabite, Edom, Ammon & Moab]
|||Angel||1. A messenger; a member of the angelic host of heaven; those who ascend and descend upon theLadder (Christ), bringing revelation of truths to men from God (Genesis 29:12, 13; Luke 1:19, 26-38; John 1:51; Daniel 8:15, 16; ); those who will separate and gather the wheat and the tare at the end of the age; (Daniel 8:16, Hebrews 1:14, Psalms 103:21; Matthew 24:31); every child of God is granted a ministering angel that is given to protect him/her from the wiles of the devil (Job 1:9, 10; Psalm 34:7; Matthew 18:10); A church leader (Rev 2:1, 8, 12, 18, 3:1, 7, 14). [see Host of Heaven1,3; Ladder]
2. A messenger or a spiritual leader (a pastor/elder/bishop); a human agent carrying a worldwide message of God's grace, mercy, salvation and judgment. The messengers are noted to be of human origin based on the breadth of the message - the entire world (Revelation 2:1, 8, 12, 18, 3:1, 7, 14; 14:6-12; Matthew 28:18-20) 
3. (of the Lord) A term used to refer to a heavenly messenger of God, but often more specifically, to Jesus Christ Himself. Contextually, the Bible identifies unique characteristics belonging only to God when it uses the term, referring to the pre-incarnate manifestation of Christ (Genesis 16:7-13; 18:1-3, 10, 13, 14, 17-19; 22:15, 16; Exodus 3:1-6; 13:21, 22; Numbers 22:22-35; Joshua 5:13-15; Judges 6:11-24; 13:8-23) [see Michael].
|||Apostle||Meaning "one who is sent", the group of men, chosen specifically by Jesus who received personal face-to-face instruction, counsel, and a calling by Jesus Christ Himself. The Apostles were to begin the work of spreading the gospel and forming the Christian Church after Christ. All who heard the Apostles' message and would be saved were to become disciples of Jesus Christ (John 17:6-26; Acts 1:2-8; 1 Corinthians 15:1-9)
|||Ark of the Testimony||Ark of the Covenant/ Mercy Seat (Ex 25:10-22; Psalm 80:1)
|||Armageddon||Comprised of two Hebrew words: har (meaning mountain) Megiddo or giddeon(meaning slaughter) - "Mountain of the Slaughter", the place where the wicked will be gathered together by the deceptive influence of frogs out of the mouth of the Dragon, Beast, and False Prophet, to fight against God and the faithful (2 Chronicles 35:20-22) and ultimately be destroyed by the wrath of God (Judges 5:19, 20; Rev 16:12-16; 19:17-20; 20:9; Ezekiel 38:14-23; Job 38:22, 23). Not an actual geographic location, but spiritually speaking, indicative of the frame of mind and character of those who reject the gospel of Christ (1st Angel's Message), despise God's commandments (2nd Angel's Message), and will ultimately be overthrown (3rd Angel's Message). That which brings all the forces of evil together in confederacy is Spiritualism (the frogs), and is marshaled together to establish a Sunday Law, the catalyst for the battle of Armageddon. [see Kishon; Time of Trouble; Confederate/Confederacy; Spiritualism; Three Angels' Message; Overthrown; Supper of the Great God]
|||Arm (Right)||Strength, safety, defense, security (Jeremiah 17:5; Lamentation 2:3)
|||Arms||Military forces and might (Daniel 11:31) [see A Host]
|||Ass by the way||The ass [a beast of burden] which appears in the story of the Man of God sent from Judah to give warning to the King of Israel, Jeroboam, to the North, symbolizes that which the false prophet (Apostate Protestantism) rides upon and which will bear the burden of, and accompany Apostate Adventism to its demise, Spiritualism (the Dragon Power). As seen in the story of the Man of God, he is killed by the Lion by the way (the King of the North) and his dead body lies before the Lion and the Ass by the way who accompanied him. The wonder of the story is that the Lion neither devours the Man of God's dead carcass, nor the donkey that stands beside him, but allows the False Prophet to handle and bury the dead body without harm. The natural wonder in the story implies its spiritual significance where the Lion, the Ass and the False Prophet stand together in awe before the dead corpse of the Man of God. (1 Kings 13). [see Spiritualism; Jeroboam, son of Nebat; Man of God; Lion (by the way)]
|||Assyria/Assyrian||Kingdom to the north of Palestine who under Sennacherib (705-681BC), subdued and scattered the Northern Kingdom of Samaria, and threatened with boastful and blasphemous words to do the same to the Southern Kingdom of Judah under Hezekiah (Isaiah 36). A prophetic reference to Satan and his understudy the Papacy, who exalt themselves above God, persecute and seek to desolate the saints of God (Nahum 3:1-6). Just as Sennacherib boasted of his ability to subdue the entire world (Isaiah 37:17, 18), he thought to lay waste Judah as well. The Lord promised that the gates of hell would not prevail against the city of God, the church triumphant, but that He Himself would defend it. The Lord Himself destroyed the army of Sennacherib and just as the Papacy will be slain by those who it once upheld, Sennacherib was killed by his two sons in his home palace. (Isaiah 14:12-19, 24-26, 37:33-38; Jeremiah 50:17; 2 Kings 17:28, 29; 2 Thessalonians 2:3-12; Revelation 17:12-18). [see King of the North/North Country/King of Assyria; North; Razor for hire; Bee of Assyria]
|||Babbler||One who has drunk strong/strange wine and has become drunk with false doctrine (Proverbs 23:29, 30). [see Wine; Wine (Old); Drunk (to be)]
|||Babylon||Name given to the land encompassing the city once called Babel [meaning "confusion"], founded by the Assyrian Nimrod the mighty hunter of men who built in his city a tower and great palaces (Genesis 10:9, 11:1-9; Isaiah 23:13). Meaning "Gate of the gods", the nation of Babylon like the Assyrians, were historically the oppressors of God's people from the north (north of Palestine). God's people are literally and spiritually taken captive by Babylon when they fell into apostasy (Jeremiah 21:10); 1Used in the Bible as a symbol of religious apostasy/confusion, spurious worship that brings about destruction (Isaiah 21:9, 24:4-6, 10-12; Rev 18); 2The spiritual name given to a land of graven images, a city that enriches the merchants of the world with her costly living, trading in all types of wares and the souls of men (Jeremiah 50:38; Rev 17:1-5, 18; 18:2, 3, 16; Gen 10:8-10, 11:6-9). Babylonian doctrine denied the incarnation of God, thus bearing a mark of the spirit of antichrist (Daniel 2:11; 1 John 4:1-3). 3The spiritual name describing the three-fold power that wages war against God and His saints throughout time. A power made up of a diversity of people (mingled people) who join in confederacy against God. (Numbers 22-25; Jeremiah 50:35-37; Mark 6:14-28; Rev 16:19). 4The term used secretly for the Roman Empire by the Apostles and Early Church to conceal/mask any discussions made of that power (1 Peter 5:13). [see Assyrian, Armageddon; Babylon (Mystery); King of the North/North Country/King of Assyria; Dragon, Beast and False Prophet; Confederate/Confederacy]
|||Babylon (Mystery)||A Church (Rev 18:2-8), a Kingdom (Rev 13:1, 2), and a City (Rev 16:19; 17:18; 18:10); the harlot church whose greatest sin is that she "made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication". The Papal Roman system fulfills the prophetic mystery, exhibiting all the characteristics of Babylon for 1,260years. However, after 1798, when Babylon received a deadly wound, the Protestant Churches through their rejection of the end-time message given as of 1842 (1st Angel's Message), took up the banner on behalf of their mother, Babylon (Revelation 17:1-5). Protestantism became part of this corrupt system with the rejection of the 1st Angel's Message, bringing on the 2nd Angel's message stating that "Babylon is Fallen". The 3rd Angel's message of Revelation 14 is the last warning to the world to flee the rites, rituals, and idols made popular by the great whore and her daughters. [see Woman (Harlot Woman), Rejoicing City (the), Queen of Heaven (The), Beast(leopard-like), Pharaoh; Terrible of the Nations, Great City/Golden City, Rabbah, Three Angels' Message2; Spirit of Prophecy Vol. 4 Chp15 pg232.1,2 ]
|||Balaam||Symbol of the Apostate Church that is in collusion (fornication) with the state (Balak) (Revelation 2:14; Numbers 31:16, Numbers 25:1-3; Numbers 22-24)
|||Balak||Symbol of the state or government that seeks power (blessings) from the Apostate Church(Balaam) to overthrow the faithful of God (Revelation 2:14; Numbers 31:16; Numbers 25:1-3; Numbers 22-24)
|||Beast||A kingdom or nation (Daniel 7:17)
|||Beast (lamb-like)||A prophetic allusion to the United States, a nation founded by those once held under the oppressions of both religious and personal persecution, who through its Constitution vowed to uphold religious tolerance and the free will of all men through republicanism (government by the people, for the people). These gentle, lamb-like qualities would in time give way to Dragon-like principles, spoken by the same people who through their vote bear voice to their will. This once blessed nation of God that was the hallmark of Protestantism world-wide will surrender its allegiance to the leopard-like beast (Revelation 13:11-17) [see Glorious Land (The), Protestantism, False Prophet; Daily (the)]
|||Beast (leopard-like)||A prophetic allusion to the nation state that would arise in the densely populated (Rev 17:15) region of the Mediterranean bearing characteristics of the four-world empires described in Daniel 7:2-7. The self-exalting power would speak boastful/blasphemous words against God, God's seat/throne, and His people for 1,260 years and would then receive a deadly wound. The miraculous healing of the wound (a deceptive sign and lying wonder mimicking Jesus' resurrection) causes all to worship him (a spiritual/religious act) whose names are not written in the Lambs Book of Life. An allusion to the Papacy, who ruled over kings of the world and their subjects during the Dark Ages and received a deadly wound in 1798 at the hands of Napolean. The deadly wound will be fully healed with the enforcement of the Image to the Beast (Rev 13:1-18; 2 Thess 2:3-10). [see Woman (Harlot Woman); Babylon (Mystery); Abomination of Desolation; Image to the Beast; Bottomless Pit3] 
|||Beast from the Abyss (Bottomless Pit)||(Revelation 17: 8; 11:7) The spiritual power that arose in 1793 that gives rise to modern Spiritualism and the New Age Movement (The 'Dragon' power of the triumvirate spoken of in Revelation 16:13) comprised of: Transformism, Skepticism, Atheism, Humanism, Pantheism, Eroticism, Romanticism and a host of other demonic influences. [see Spiritualism]
|||Bee of Assyria||The Assyrian armies that the Lord would raise up to punish His rebellious sons Israel and Judah. [see Razor for Hire, Fly of Egypt]
|||Binding off||A term taken from Isaiah 8:16 used in the Spirit of Prophecy to denote a sealing, a gathering or scattering, a closing off or completion, and a tying together so that one may or may not be shaken out. Denotes the message (Third Angel's Message) bringing all to the hour of decision where they will receive either the seal of God or the mark of the Beast. The message and time in prophecy is given by the term "hour", such as:
  - "In the same hour came forth fingers of man's hand and wrote over against the... wall" Daniel 5:5 - marking the close of Belshazzar's and Babylon's probation
  - "For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say" Luke 12:12 - marking the wise who are sealed and empowered by the Holy Spirit to give their testimony on behalf of the Truth
  - "To us, as God's servants, has been entrusted the third angel's message, the binding-off message, that is to prepare a people for the coming of our King." {LS 423.1}
  - "He bade me look in an opposite direction, and I saw a little company traveling a narrow pathway. All seemed to be firmly united, bound together by the truth, inbundles, or companies. Said the angel, "The third angel is binding, or sealing, them in bundles for the heavenly garner." {EW 89.1}
|||Bishop||See Elder
|||Bitter/Sweet (Taste)||An experience of the people of God that is designed to increase faith, heighten trust in God, and to vicariously share in the bitter/sweet experience of Christ in redeeming the world (Heb 2:10; Daniel 11:40-45); is also used of God to sift the wheat from the tare (Ezek 2:8-10): Children of Israel eat Passover lamb w/ bitter herbs before deliverance [Ex 12:8]; Children of Israel surrounded before Red Sea [Ex 14:9-15]; Ezekiel eats the book [Ezek 3:1-14]; Disciples' experience at Christ's Death and Resurrection; Great Disappointment of 1844 [Rev 10:10]; Time of Trouble for the 144,000[Daniel 12:1, Revelation 10:8-10]. [see Sigh & Cry]
|||Blaspheme/Blasphemy||To speak reproachfully or with contempt towards God; to ascribe to God ungodly characteristics (Matthew 12:22-32; Luke 12:9, 10; Luke 20:1-8); the act of proclaiming to be God or ascribing characteristics of God to oneself, for example, the ability and prerogative to forgive sins (John 10:33; Luke 5:21, 7:49; Mark 2:7). The biblical punishment for blaspheme was stoning (1 Kings 21:10-13), however, Jesus, who was accused of blaspheme, was hung on a tree by order of the chief priests and council so that Jesus may be cursed of God. The chief priests and council, though operating from evil, satanic motives, fulfilled the purposes of God (Matthew 26:63-66; Deuteronomy 21:23; Galatians 3:13; Isaiah 53:1-12). [see Head and Tail, Branch and Rush]
|||Blast of the Terrible Ones...Storm Against the Wall||A prophetic reference to the Terrible of the Nations (Rome), which has in the past and will in the near future through its proxy, Apostate Protestantism, issue an unrighteous decree (Sunday Law) that will be as a storm (overflowing scourge) against the Wall, God's Commandments (Isaiah 25:4, 28:2, 3, 14-20). [see Terrible of the Nations/Terrible Ones, Wall (The)]
|||Blindness/Deafness (Spiritual)||To be unaware of one's spiritual condition (Rev 3:14-17); to be in a state of darkness, lacking wisdom/knowledge (Isaiah 29:9-12, 42:16; Romans 2:19): having a rebellious spirit and hardened heart towards truth, rejecting the truth (John 9:35-41; Acts 7:51-54; Isaiah 5:13, 6:9-12; Jeremiah 5:21; Ezekiel 12:2 Amos 4:1-13); to be unconverted; those who have not received the Early and Latter Rain leaving them unfruitful and blinded to the gospel [prophecy - seeing afar off] (2 Peter 1:1, 5-9); holding to traditions rather than the truths of God (Ezek 12:2; Matthew 13:9-16, 15:14; Luke 24:25; Matthew 25:8-13; Hebrews 5:10-14; Jeremiah 5:21-25, 6:16-19); the condition of those who reject the End Time message found in the Little Book -> Reject the Law of God -> Reject the Spirit of Prophecy -> Reject Jesus Christ (Isaiah 30:8-11; Jeremiah 8:20; 14:10-12; Matt 11:16-26). [see Shut Door Message, Briers and Thorns, Tares, Overthrown]
|||Blood||A symbol of that which delivers men from the power of Satan and secures our final redemption; a symbol of life (Genesis 9:4; Lev 3:17); [innocent blood, shedding of] requires atonement - symbolized in Abel and Christ whose blood were shed unjustly (Isaiah 53:4-9; Matt 23:35, 27:23, 24). That which ratifies a covenant (Genesis 3:21; Zechariah 9:11; Exodus 24:8; Matthew 26:26-28)
|||Blood Covenant||"the most solemn covenant known to the Oriental" or to Mankind. The blood covenant outranked every other relation in life and was entered into with full knowledge of the terms and conditions of the covenant agreement. God entered into a blood covenant with mankind in the Garden of Eden and when He and Abraham passed between the pieces of the sacrifice that were cut in two (Genesis 15:8-18; see also Jeremiah 34:18, 10; Hebrews 7:5, 9). Thus Jesus became blood-relations to mankind in becoming fully man and taking on our fallen nature, sharing in our infirmities and calling us His brethren (Hebrews 2:9-18). In the gospel of Leviticus it is shown that if a person were to fall into debt or bondage and has lost his inheritance, he/she could pay his/her way out of the debt or only the nearest of kin through a blood relationship could redeem the possession (Leviticus 25:24-28, 47-49; Ruth 2:20, 3:9, 12, 13, 4:1-14). Therefore, Jesus again, being a blood relation with the human race and closer than even a brother, the right of redemption fell to Him alone in all the universe to redeem the inheritance of mankind lost to sin (Hebrews 2:9-11, 14; 4:15; Matthew 8:17). [see A.T. Jones, The Consecrated Way to Christian Perfection]
|||Bloody City (The)||A term given by inspiration to the city of Nineveh, known for its cruelty and barbarism (Nahum 3:1, 19; Habakkuk 2:12). Portrayed as the mistress of witchcrafts and the harlot of the nations, Nineveh, the cursed city that in the time of Jonah found repentance, sought the Lord, and was spared (Jonah 3:5-10). Its doom is however forecasted in the book of Nahum [see Rejoicing City (the)]
|||Blue (color)||Symbol of obedience (Exodus 28:31-33, 37, 38; Numbers 15:38, 39)
|||Book (the little)||The Book of Daniel that is sealed until the Time of the End and particularly the last 6 verses of Chapter 11 (Daniel 12:4, 9; 10:2, 8-11; Ezek 2:8-10; Revelation 5:1-12; Revelation 10:1-11)
|||Book (sealed)||The Bible which contains all the divine oracles of God and the history of the world and all people for all times. Obscured for centuries and generation after generation by traditions, men's interpretations, teachings and error, Jesus alone can open the seals and bring the true revelations and their meaning contained within (Revelation 5:1-9). [see Seals (seven), Lion of the Tribe of Judah, Seven Thunders]
|||Book of Life (the Lamb's) [Book of the Living]||"the writing of the house of Israel", belonging to Christ, where the names of all the redeemed throughout time are written. Christ professed that God is not the God of the dead but of the living" (Matthew 22:32; Romans 4:17). Further Christ said that though a man should die, He will live again, on the day of the Resurrection of Life (John 5:24-29, 11:23-26). Those who have professed and accepted Christ as Savior by faith, have their names written in the book. However, one's name can be blotted out if the one does not continue to walk and defend the faith once imparted to the saints in their own lives. Those whose names remain in the Book of Life have kept the faith having their sins blotted out by the blood of the Lamb, run their race with patience unto the end, and have a crown of righteousness prepared for them which the Lord Himself will give to them on that day. All whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life will be cast into the Lake of Fire, which is the Second Death (Ezekiel 13:9, 18:23-29, 33:12; Jude 3; 2 Peter 2:20-22; Romans 11:19, 22; Exodus 32:31-33; Psalm 69:28, 109:13; Revelation 2:10, 3:5; Hebrews 12:1; 2 Timothy 4:6-8; Revelation 20:11-15). [see Day of Atonement (antitypical); Chaff (of threshing floor); Investigative Judgment]
|||Born of the Spirit||Jesus is the firstborn [first to be born] of the Spirit, having literally been conceived by the Holy Spirit and not a man (Matthew 1:18, 20-23). A term signifying those who have experienced the rebirth after dying and being buried to sin through the resurrection power of Jesus Christ. Those who are born of the Spirit are the literal and spiritual children of God who were not born of the will of men but by the will of God. Those who are born of the spirit are empowered by the indwelling Holy Spirit to bear fruit of the Spirit in their lives and are entrusted with the gifts of the Spirit to be co-laborers with Christ in performing the works of God (John 1:12, 13, 3:5; Galatians 5:22-26; 1 Corinthians 12, 13; Philippians 3:8-15). [see Saints]
|||Bottomless Pit/Abyss||A symbol of darkness, deception, false religion, persecution, a manifestation of Satanic power; source of demonic wisdom originating here on earth (James 3:14-4:4). The term is used four times in the Revelation and represents four distinct things:

  2. Revelation 11:7 - the place [France] where the scourge of Atheism and Spiritualism arise as a result of the French Revolution. [see Egypt (Land of)]
  3. Revelation 17:8 - the place of perdition from which the Beast from the Sea (Rev 13:1-3), also called the man of sin and son of perdition (2 Thessalonians 2:3) arises after its deadly wound is healed (Ezekiel 28:7-10). [see Beast (leopard-like)]
  4. Revelation 20:1-3 - the earth in a state of confusion and darkness where Satan is bound for 1000years before performing his last deception and being destroyed in the Lake of Fire (Isaiah 14:15-17; 24:17-23; Jeremiah 4:23-26). [see Supper of the Great God]
|||Branch (the)||Jesus Christ! The Servant of God who will rebuild the temple of God (1 Peter 2:3-8), will bear its glory and will sit on His throne. He shall be a priest upon His throne and He will fulfill the covenant of peace between Himself and the Father (Zechariah 3:8, 6:12, 13). [see Shepherd (the Good), Messenger (of God)]
|||Bread (corn/grain)||One's resources and possessions given by God (Ecclesiastes 11:1); food for the body; doctrine, teachings from the Word of God or a message for the spirit (Isaiah 55:1-3; Zech 9:16, 17; Isaiah 62:8, 9). [see Meat, Milk, Water]

|||Briers and Thorns||An unconverted person; those who will be burned in the fire; those who oppose God and His kept vine of red wine (the House of Israel); God in mercy, petitions to the briers and thorns to make peace with Him that he should not caste His fury upon them (Isaiah 55:13, 27:4, 5; Hebrew 6:4-8). [see Tares; Foolish (the)/Wicked (the); Head and Tail, Branch and Rush; Zidon; ? Trees of Righteousness]
|||Bronze||A metal alloy of primarily copper and tin whose properties are its tensile strength, non- corrosive nature and attractive golden brown appearance. The serpent on the pole foreshadowing Jesus was made of bronze; the Son of Man's (Jesus) skin is likened to the color of bronze (Ezekiel 40:3; Daniel 10:5, 6; Revelation 1:13-15) - signifying He has the appearance of man but the strength of God.
|||Bruise||1. To fall upon, crush, harm, kill; the outcome of the enmity between the Seed of the woman (Christ) and the serpent (the Devil) where the Seed of the woman will receive a wound to his feet but the serpent will receive a deadly wound to the head (Genesis 3:15);
2. To crush, break, shatter; The acts of the nation whose works fulfill the prophecy of bruising the people of God, killing Christ, and crushing all nations in its path, Rome [Pagan and Papal] (Daniel 2:40; .
3. (Heb: daka) To crush, be crushed, be contrite, be broken; that which it pleased the Lord to doto Jesus Christ, making His life a sacrifice for sin to win the redemption of men (Isaiah 53:10)
|||Budding Leaves of Spring||Prophetic parable given by Christ to be a sign to Adventism to warn of the soon coming of the Latter Rain (Luke 21:29-33). The budding leaves in spring (Joel 2:23, 24; Psalm 132:17) brought about by the Latter Rain is the sign that summer and the harvest are soon to come. The Spring time is coincident with the first temple cleansing where Adventists, like the Fig tree that only bore leaves, making a pretense of holiness and Christ-likeness but bore no fruit (Matt 21:19, 20), will be uprooted (shaken). The Summer time (harvest time) is the era of the second temple cleansing where the Gentiles who have not received the Loud Cry message and bear no fruit will be uprooted (shaken) (Jeremiah 8:20). The budding leaves of spring will blossom and fill the world with fruit for the harvest (Isaiah 27:6; 61:11). [see Early (Former) Rain; Shaking (the), Times of Refreshing, Summer, Harvest, Lamp]
|||Bullock (Bull)||A very stubborn and strong willed animal that does not desire to be yoked. We are likened to the bull who does not want to surrender to God and His will, and therefore fall under His chastisement (Jeremiah 31:18, 19). Yet, it is those whom He loves that He chastises (Revelation 3:18, 19). After we have endured the chastisement, we return to God in shame of our waywardness and repent and He shows us mercy (Jeremiah 31:20). We then can walk in righteousness, taking up the yoke of Christ that we may find rest for our souls (Matthew 11:28-30). The bull in the sanctuary services is sacrificed to make atonement and consecration for the priests. We are called be a royal priesthood and holy nation unto the Lord (Leviticus 8:14, 15).
|||Butter and Honey/Milk & Honey||Symbols of a fertile land where there is an abundance of grass for herds to graze, producing offspring and milk, and abounding with vegetation where bees pollinate. A description of the Glorious Land (Palestine) that God reserved for the Children of Israel (Ezekiel 20:5, 6, 15). Spiritually, godly wisdom and the Word of God that keeps one from evil (Isaiah 7:15, 22; Jeremiah 11:1-5) [see Milk, Honey, Glorious Land (The)]
|||Cain||first born of Adam; foreshadowing those who pervert the pure gospel message of salvation through Jesus Christ and receiving His Righteousness by faith, for a salvation based on man's dogmas/opinions and works; followers of Cain receive a mark and are cursed (Genesis 4:3-15; Galatians 1:6-9; Rev 13:16; 14:9-11; 1 John 3:12)
|||Camels||A symbol of Islam just as Chariots, horses, and asses (Isaiah 21:7; Judges 7:12)
|||Candlesticks (seven)||Seven churches of Revelation Chapters 2 and 3, representing the Christian Church throughout time (Revelation 1:20). The Law of God (Proverbs 6:23)
|||Cattle (fat/lean)||Influential members (wealthy, educated) of the House of God who prey upon and force out (butt with their horns) the weak and lean cattle. The fat cattle are served through corruption and graft by bad shepherds at the expense of the lean cattle. The Lord, the Good Shepherd will judge in righteousness the cattle, both fat and lean as well as the shepherds and give each their due reward (Ezekiel 34). [see Wheat; Tares; Shepherd]
|||Cedars of Lebanon, Fir Trees, and Oaks of Bashan||Strong, tall, costly trees, full of sap that are the planting of the Lord (Psalm 104:16). Trees used in the building of the Temple of God in the time of Solomon (2 Chronicles 22:4; 1 Kings 5:7-10, 6:18, 9:11). The tall and lofty trees are compared to the arrogance, self-will, and pride of those who oppose God (Isaiah 2:12, 13; Zechariah 11:1, 2). [ see Briars and Thorns]
|||City (A)||A geopolitical kingdom (Rev 11:8; 14:8; 17:18; 18:2, 10, 16, 18, 19, 21; 21:2)
|||Chaff (of threshing floor)||That which is blown away with every wind of doctrine (Ephesians 4:14; Daniel 2:35) and the whirlwind (Hosea 13:3); Tares; that which is burned in the fire; the wicked and lost who are not written in the Book of Life; those who have not embraced the New Covenant promise of having their sins blotted out and having their iniquities remembered no more (Job 19:6-11; Isaiah 5:22-24, 41:15, 16; Jeremiah 14:10-12; Matthew 13:40-42; Luke 3:17; Revelation 12:8; 20:15; Daniel 2:35) [see Harvest/Reap]
|||Chaldean||(Mesopotamia) Babylon/Babylonian (2 Kings 25:10-13; Isaiah 47:1-8; Jeremiah 21:1-4;35:11; Acts 7:2; Revelation 18:1-7)
|||Chariots & Horsemen||military power (1 Kings 1:5; 20:1)
|||Children of the Day/Light||the wise who hear and understand God's prophetic message and live vigilantly in anticipation of the Second Coming of Christ. Heeding the counsel of Christ to Watch and Pray, they are not taken unaware nor deceived by the peace and safety message of the false prophets. They walk in the light as Christ is in the light, they remain sober and they are not made drunk with false doctrines (1 Thessalonians 5:1-11). [see Wise (the); Path of the Just / Paths to Dwell in; ? Children of the Night/Darkness; "Peace and Safety"]
|||Children of the East||Descendants of Ishmael (sons of Islam/Arabs) whose role is to bring death and destruction to the earth (Revelation 9:4) and economic collapse at the end of the world. Historically they have been a curse and a blessing to the Children of Israel. Ishmaelites delivered Joseph, taking him to Egypt after purchasing him from his brothers who purposed to kill him. God the Father ordained that wise men from the east should provide financial resources (gold and myrrh) to Joseph and Mary to support them and Jesus while in Egypt. The Received Texts (Textus Receptus) were preserved in the schools/universities of Islam during the Middle Ages from which the King James Bible was derived. Islam aided the Protestant Reformation in that when the Church of Rome sent out Crusaders to martyr Protestant Reformers, the Crusaders were often confronted and checked by Islamic forces who warred against them (Genesis 16:12, 25:6, 37:28; Judges 6:3, 33; 1 Kings 4:30; Isaiah 11:14) [see Kedar (sons of); Islam; Horse (Wild Arabian), East Wind, Winds (Holding the four)]
|||Children of the Night/Darkness||the sons of disobedience whose works are done in the dark and they rather darkness than light. These remain dead in their trespasses and sins, they rather sleep than remain vigilant, they heed the counsels of the false prophets rather than studying to show themselves approved unto God, they drink the wine of dissipation and become drunk with false doctrine and will eventually be overthrown as Christ comes upon them as a thief in the night (1 Thessalonians 5:1-7; Ephesians 2:1-3). [see Foolish (the)/Wicked (the); "Peace and Safety"; ? Children of the Day/Light]
|||Chittim||The island of Cyprus where Genseric of the Vandals launched its war against Western Roman Empire as portrayed in the 2nd Trumpet (Isaiah 23:1; Daniel 11:30) Christendom / The Christian World = Just as Palestine and its neighboring nations were the center of theater for God's early church in the Old Testament, the United States and Europe now occupy those positions for the Christian Church per the Spirit of Prophecy. It is here that the primary acts of God's Remnant People and Apostate Protestantism will be enacted related to Last Day prophetic events that will pull the rest of the world into the global conflict between God and Satan. (Revelation 17:13, 14; 18:3, 4)
|||Church (the)||from the Greek word ekklesia, which means "called-out ones", those who believe God and put their trust in Him; those who walk by faith; those who obey God's voice, keep His charge, and keep His commandments, statutes and laws (Genesis 11:27-32; 15:6; 26:5). [see Woman, Woman (Harlot Woman), Woman (Pure Woman, A virgin)]
|||"City and a Tower"||A phrase taken from the account of the building of the ancient city of Babel by Nimrod, where in defiance to God the people gathered together rather than spreading and repopulating the earth. Further, in self-worship the people built a tower to "make a name for themselves" and in open contempt for God's promise never to destroy the earth by flood (Genesis 9:11-16). The city, a symbol for government (political power) and a tower, a symbol for church craft gives a prelude to the combined elements of church and state that would typify Modern Babylon (Genesis 11:1-5; Matthew 21:33-40; Isaiah 5:1-7). [see Tower]
|||City (Joyous & Tumultuous)||A reference to Babylon that revels in her sin. The Children of Israel take on its characteristics in their adulterous worship of sun, moon, and stars upon the housetops and their licentious worship (Isaiah 22:1-3, 32:13, 14). [see Rejoicing City (the)]
|||Clay||Religious relationship (church-craft); we are clay in God's hands (Isa 64:8; Jeremiah 18:6; Romans 9:20, 21; Daniel 2:41-43; 2 Corinthians 4:7). [see Babylon (Mystery)]
|||Clay (miry)||Soiled or corrupted church-craft; church or religion that is corrupted with false doctrine (Daniel 2:41; 2 Samuel 22:43; Isaiah 10:6, 57:20). [see Iron Mixed with Miry Clay]
|||Cleansed (tsadaq: Hebrew)||Word used in Daniel 8:14 with relation to the cleaning of the heavenly sanctuary meaning to make right, justified, made righteous. Cleansing the Temple = a prophesied work of Jesus (Psalm 69:9) at the commencement of his earthly ministry and at the end of His ministry that is both foreshadowed in the Old Testament and paralleled in the workings of prophetic movements in the Time of the End. In zeal for His Father's house that had become a den of thieves, Christ overturns the objects of reproach and expels those who profane God's house. Jesus' cleansing made way for the sick and meek in heart that thirsted for righteousness to enter in and receive a blessing thereafter (Matthew 21:12-14). God foreshadowed Christ's two phased cleansing or purging, in dealing with Gideon and those who would go to battle with him against the Midianites (Judges 7:1-7). Recall God pared the mighty host of Gideon in two waves down to 300 faithful men through whom He would bring victory over the foes of Israel. Similarly, God performs a two-phase cleansing of His final victorious church body, typified again in the Millerite History, and finally fulfilled in End Time Adventism:
Millerite History
  - June 1842 - The Protestant Churches close the door on the 1 st Angel's Message, signaling their union with Babylon and bringing about the first cleansing of the Advent Movement. The 2nd Angel's Message is inaugurated at this time but is not empowered until the Midnight Cry of August-October 1844
  - October 22, 1844 - the Great Disappointment of October 22, 1844 caused the clear majority of Advent believers to return to their former Protestant faith, become part of a radical offshoot movement, or reject Christianity all together, signaling the second cleansing of early Adventism. With the arrival of the 3 rd Angel's Message, the 50 Adventist that followed Christ into the Most Holy Place would enter into covenant with the Lord in establishing God's last day movement and church Last Day Adventist
  - The passage of the Sunday Law will mark the "end of probation" for Adventism in that it will cause that which can be shaken to be shaken out and that which is built on the Rock, Jesus Christ, to remain. This event signals the first cleansing for Last Day Adventism [see Shaking (the)]
  - The final cleansing will be completed and man's probation would have ended when Michael stands-up [see Shut Door Message, Closed Door]
|||Cloud(s)||
1. The presence of God (Exodus 40:34-38; Numbers 9:15-22; Numbers 12:5-10; Deuteronomy 31:15; 1 Corinthians 10:2).
2. Angels (Daniel 7:13; Matthew 16:27; 24:30, 31; Rev 1:7); Chariot of the Lord (Psalm 104:3; 68:17; Isa 19:1; Matt 25:31; Rev 1:7; Manuscript Releases vol. 17 1236.2.2). Jesus comes to His Father with the Clouds in 1844 to commence the Investigative Judgment (Matt 25:31-34). Jesus returns to earth on clouds and reaps the earth (Revelation 1:7; 14:14).
|||Cloud and Fire||The manifestation of the presence of God that led the Children of Israel out of Egypt, through the wilderness and into the Promised Land. The same was used to lead the Advent movement out of spiritual Egypt and Babylon as portrayed in the Angel of Revelation 10. Similarly, God's church triumphant in the last days will be led by that same Cloud of Smoke by day and a Pillar of Fire by night (Isaiah 4:2-6). [ See Cloud(s)1]
|||Closed Door||Culmination of the Shut Door Message, the end of probation; known and brought about only by Jesus Christ (Rev 3:7); symbolizes the end of judgment. The Nation of Israel who rejected Jesus as the Lamb of God and therefore, their true High Priest who moved into the heavenly sanctuary to make intercession and atonement for them. Jesus signified this Closed Door when He said "Your house is left unto you desolate" (Matthew 23:38). When probation has closed, the fate of all persons has been decided (Revelation 22:11, 12); there remains no priest nor intercessor for the unjust (the overthrown); no matter how much they cry aloud to repent, they will not be heard (Job 19:6-10; Ezekiel 8; Luke 16:26; Mark 11:12-14, 20, 21; Matthew 25:10-13) [see Investigative Judgment; Shut Door Message; Night; Overthrown; Song of Moses & the Lamb; House Filled with Smoke]
|||Cloven Tongues as of Fire||A wonderful manifestation of the power of God given to the early Apostles at the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost - 50 days after the crucifixion of Christ) where the Holy Spirit descended upon them and granted each the ability to speak and preach the gospel in a foreign language. The cloven tongues, divers from one another and from their native tongue, was an intelligible language as Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews, and proselytes, Cretes and Arabians, all heard the Apostles preach in their own native tongue or language. This work of the Holy Spirit revealed to all generations hereafter that language would never be a barrier for the spreading of the gospel and that the hearers of the good news need not learn Hebrew, Greek or Aramaic, but that God would make His truths manifest to all (Acts 2:1-12).
|||Coals (live)||Purification and power (Isaiah 6:6);
|||Communism||Political system founded on the principles of Karl Marx whose focus was on communal ownership of all assets, distribution of assets/benefits based on needs, and governmental control of assets (no private property). The system promotes classism where the proletariat is governed by an elite "ruling class". Marx once stated that "religion is the opioid of the masses" and therefore communism strictly prohibits the exercise of all religions. Karl Marx used the term Bonapartism to describe what would become communism based on the French regime under Napoleon. France under Napoleon Bonaparte [the King of the South], therefore, could be considered one of the first, if not the first, communist state.
|||Confederate/Confederacy||The secretive coming together of the forces of evil (joining hands) to war against God and His elect. As in the case of the Scribes and Pharisees who were at odds with one another over the doctrine of the resurrection, the two joined forces through craft and plotted as one to see the death of Christ. Similarly, Pilot and Herod, two sworn enemies of darkness who through confederacy in persecuting Jesus became friends, so shall it be in the last days against the people of God. (Psalm 83:1-5; Isaiah 8:9-12, 54:15-17; Daniel 6:7; Luke 23:11, 12, 38; Matthew 26:3, 4; Rev 16:13-16, 17:12-14, 17) [see Craft, Modern Babylon, Modern Egypt, False Prophet, Number #102]
|||Corn||Spiritual Revival (Hosea 14:7). Jesus describes three stages of corn development, followed by a harvest reaping: first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear (Mark 4:26-29). This parallels the Three Angel's messages in the last days that must go out to the world before a reaping (Revelation 14:6-16) [See Refreshing, Latter Rain; Three Angel's Messages]
|||Corn, New Wine, Oil||Corn for bread, new wine for drink, and oil for anointing (consecration and blessings used in the priestly service); symbolic of doctrine and teachings; the tithe offerings brought into the temple of the Lord (Genesis 27:8; Nehemiah 10:39, 13:5, 12; Joel 1:10; Haggai 1:11)
|||Counter Reformation||The Church of Rome's counter offensive movement, started during the Council of Trent (1545-1563) to stem the rising tide of the Protestant Reformation and to raise the image of the declining church. The Council and the movement condemned all doctrines of the Protestant Reformation and enforced stricter observation of Catholic tenets. The Catholic Church had been weakened by multi-national uprisings to the church, the Great Schism, and the works of the Protestat Reformers. The Counter Reformation, championed by the newly found Jesuit order (aka "Foot soldiers of the Pope"), promoted the following Catholic doctrines:
  - The Pope was the true Vicar of Christ on Earth and all who spoke out against the holiness of the Pope were to be excommunicated and killed
  - The Catholic Church is the only true church and those who speak against, or practice any faith contrary to its tenets were to be excommunicated and banned from heaven, anathema
  - The Jesuits helped to subdue Protestant Reformers through force, using war-like tactics gained from the founder of the Jesuit order, Ignatius of Loyola, a renowned military commander; the Jesuits infiltrated "heretic Protestant movements" to subvert their growth
  - Sanctioned the Inquisition and condemnation of free speech, free press, and free thought/conscience to thwart the growth of Protestantism
  - Strengthened the doctrine of the Holiness of Mary, a theme often attacked by the Protestant Reformers
  - The Catholic Church sought to soften its image through the promotion of the arts. By commissioning patron painters and artisans, the artworks begun during the Counter Reformation often portrayed the Madonna and Child in a more life-like, sensually appealing manner (Madonna portrayed as a real woman with hips and bosoms). Much of the art work that predated the Counter Reformation were touched-up by patron artists to feature a halo above the Madonna and Child, emphasizing the doctrine of the sanctity and holiness of Mary.
  - The reinterpretation of the prophecies of Daniel 7, 8 and 9 that speak of a little horn power that would speak blasphemous words, would persecute the saints of God, and would seek to change times (the day of worship changed from God's ordained 7 th day Sabbath to the traditional pagan day of worship for the sun, Sunday) and laws (the 4th commandment); as well as the prophecy of Revelation 6 that reveals the history of the church through the 4 horsemen. Suggested that these prophecies interpreted as the then current Church of Rome by Protestant Reformers, were to be interpreted in the future in certain cases and in the past in others but were not relevant to the time; thus founding the preterist and futurist interpretation of prophecy. [see Protestantism; Reform Movements]
|||Covering & Removing of God's Hand||God hid Moses in the cleft of the rock and covered him with His hands. When His hands were removed, Moses beheld the glory of the LORD (Exodus 33:21-34:10). Understanding of Jesus' prophecies was withheld due to prejudices and man's interpretations. Jesus came after His resurrection and ascension and opened to His disciples all the things He had said to them concerning Himself (Luke 24:44-46). God hid an error on the 1843 chart to test His people, however, when He removed His hands He revealed understanding of doctrine that had been long forgotten.
|||Craft||Satanic subtlety and works; deception, secretive cunning, scheming, confederation, and flatteries. The workings of the seed of the serpent. (Genesis 3:1-5; 2 Samuel 15:1-6; Job 15:5; Psalm 83:1-4; Isaiah 5:20-24; Daniel 8:25, 11:32, 34; Matthew 21:25-27, 22:15-18, 26:3-5, 59, 60; Mark 14:1, 2; Luke 20:19-23) [see Subtle; Confederate/Confederacy; Wise (Wisdom) of this World]
|||Craft (Consummate)||The original workings of Satan that through deception, cunning, subtlety and scheming causes that which is truth to appear as error and that which is error to appear as truth (Isaiah 29:15, 16, 5:20). [see Great Controversy (The)1]
|||Crooked Paths||In prideful rebellion, the people of God have refused the Old Ways of God, have created crooked paths for themselves and therefore have forsaken their peace. God has purposed to send a strong delusion to those who refused to hear His call so that they may believe a lie and perish (Isaiah 59:1-8, 30:8-11, 66:1-4; Jeremiah 6:16, 17; 2 Thessalonians 2:11, 12) [see ? Path of the Just / Paths to Dwell in/ Old Paths]
|||Crown||Symbol of royalty or of a monarchy [kingdom] (2 Samuel 1:10; 1 Chronicles 20:2; Esther 1:11, 2:17, 6:8; Mark 15:17; Revelation 12:3); 2Symbol of consecration worn by the High Priest where it bears the inscription "HOLINESS TO THE LORD" (Exodus 29:6, 39:30; Leviticus 8:9); 3A symbol of victory - all of the redeemed who overcome by the blood of the Lamb and word of their testimony, inherit/wear a Crown of Life and reign with Jesus (Isaiah 28:5, 62:3; 1 Corinthians 9:25; 2 Timothy 4:8; James 1:12; 1 Peter 5:4; Revelation 2:10, 3:11, 4:10, 20:4; Matthew 19:28; ? Job 19:9); 4 the top of one's head (Job 2:7; Isaiah 3:17) [see Overcome; ? Overthrown]
|||Crown of Glory||The reward and inheritance for the remnant, the righteous, is the Lord Himself, a diadem of beauty. We will have the Lord and His character as our crown of glory (Isaiah 28:4). The crown of glory contrasts with the crown of pride, apostate leadership and those who follow them, who will be overthrown (Isaiah 28:1-18)
|||Crown of Pride||Term used to denote the kings/leadership of Israel that the people foolishly chose to follow over God Who desired to be their King and guide (Isaiah 28:1); their prideful, boastful show of pomp while claiming fidelity and piety to God is the abomination that the Lord finds repulsive. Drunken [deceived] by strange wine, they proclaim unrighteous decrees and oppress the poor (Isaiah 10:1, 2). Further, these have forsaken the Old Paths and no longer understand God's visions and teachings. As educated ones, they along with the priests and prophets cannot understand the things of God; as for the unlearned that look up to them, they are in gross darkness. Rather than seeking the Old Paths wherein they will find peace and rest for their souls, they seek counsel of diviners, those who peep and mutter [Spiritualism], therefore storing up wrath for the day of wrath. In response, God promises to smite the shepherds and scatter the flocks at the hands of the King of the North. The same prophecy is applied to the Adventist Church at the passage of the Sunday Law. (Isaiah 28:1-15, 29:9-16, 8:11-22; Jeremiah 10:19-22; Zechariah 10:1-3; Acts of the Apostles 596.3-597.2). [see Head and Tail, Branch and Rush, Ma-her-shal'-al-hash'-baz; ? Path of the Just / Paths to Dwell in/ Old Paths]
|||Crowns (on beasts head)||political system where a monarch or central ruling authority governs and dictates law (Revelation 12:2; 13:1).
|||Cry Aloud||To pray and petition the Lord (Job 19:7; Isaiah 59:1-16; Psalm 55:17; Isaiah 58:1; 1 Timothy 2:5;John 16:23; Ezekiel 8:17, 18). [see Overthrown]
|||Cup (of God's wrath)||God's judgment; God's complete hatred towards sin which was poured out without mixture on Christ for the redeemed, but is to be poured out again on the sons of disobedience who've rejected Christ's substitutionary death on their behalf (Jeremiah 25:15-33; Matt 26:39-42; Rev 14:10, 11; 16:19; Psalm 75:8).[see Drink of the Cup]
|||Cup (full of Abominations and Filthiness of Fornication)||The cup of Babylon the Great, that is filled with the wine of fornication that all the kings, merchants and sons of men drink to their destruction. Through her trafficking and craft she has ridden upon the rulers of the world, persuading them to reap desolations upon the sons of God, and thus filling her cup with the blood of the saints and martyrs.
|||Daily (the)||From the Hebrew word tamiyd (noun), a term (adjective/adverb) meaning a daily or continual occurrence that is commonly given about the daily administration in the earthly sanctuary in the Bible. However, its use in the book of Daniel chapters 8, 11, and 12 is not as an adjective/adverb, but rather as a noun, symbolizing paganism (spiritualism). Denoting paganism, or false religion, a scourge that daily opposed and exalted itself against God and His people for a period of 1,260years (723BC-538AD); only to be replaced by the Abomination of Desolation, a morphed and more diabolical form of paganism, wrapped in a garb of Christianity for another 1,260-year period (538-1798) (Daniel 8:11, 12; 9:27; 11:31; 12:11, 12). The daily, which once restrained the Abomination of Desolation from coming forth (2 Thessalonians 2:3-7; Daniel 11:31), would in time yield its power, seat, and authority to prop-up the Abomination of Desolation (Revelation 13:2). This was made manifest between 496AD-508AD when the 7 kings of the Barbarian divisions of Rome forsook paganism and converted to Catholicism, pledging their allegiance, and lending their military power to the Papacy against its enemies. These seven kings' hosts (armies) that were used to uproot the three remaining Barbarian kings who refused to convert to Catholicism, become the power upon which the church of Rome rode for 1,260 years. The same was fulfilled in 1989 when Ronald Regan, ruler of a Protestant nation, aligned himself with Pope John Paul II (King of the North), lending his military arms and economic might to overthrow the Soviet Union (modern King of the South). The essence of the daily, the religion of Satan, is self-exaltation. Just as the Bible says that the daily is "taken away" (Daniel 12:11), the daily in the life of the followers of Christ must also be completely taken away, so that Christ may reign supreme. [see Paganism/Heathenism; Abomination of Desolation; Power, Seat & Great Authority; Sanctuary of Strength; Seven Thunders; Early Writings pg 74.2 by EGW]
|||Darkness||1. (Walking/Dwelling in) spiritual death; untruth/falsehood; unrighteousness; the wicked, the devil and his angels will be made to dwell in darkness for a millennium to grope and wander as they have caused the earth to walk in darkness; though God dwells in light and gives forth light, He also knows that which is in darkness - God never intended for mankind to know darkness (John 3:19, 20; Eph 5:13, 14; Matt 5:14-16; Ezekiel 32:7, 8; Revelation 16:10, 11, 20:1-3; Daniel 2:20-22). [see ? Light (walking/dwelling in)]
2. God covers Himself both in the light, as well as in thick darkness to veil His glory from the sons of men (Genesis 15:12-18; Exodus 14:20, 20:18-21; Deuteronomy 4:11, 5:22, 23; 2 Samuel 22:10-12). The darkness that enshrouds God may be symbolic of His unsearchable wisdom, majesty and glory- the hidden things of God that men ought not to presume upon nor venture to understand because they are not revealed by God (Deuteronomy 29:29).
|||Dark Sentences||An unknown or foreign language; spoken in reference specifically to the language of the Romans (Daniel 8:23). [see Fierce Countenance]
|||Daughter of Zion||The Last Day remnant church, the final offspring of Zion (Isaiah 62:11, 12). [see Number #144,000, ]
|||Daughters of Babylon||Prophetic allusion to the apostate churches that are born of fornication of Babylon. Babylon the great is said to be the mother of harlots like herself, therefore, the daughters of Babylon follow in the footsteps of forsaking their first love for the Lord and pursuing their self-interests of wealth, power, and earthly gain (Ezekiel 16:44-46). The Daughters of Babylon in pride misuse the sacred things of God, oppress the people of God, worship foreign gods and seek counsel from idols and sorcerers, they trade with the merchants of the world for their gain and the oppression of others, and yet think that they are beyond God's sight and will never suffer loss. God promises to bring the Daughters of Babylon down with Babylon herself (Revelation 17:5; Daniel 5:2-4; Psalm 137:8, 9; Isaiah 47:1-3, 6-15). [see Babylon (Mystery); Woman (Harlot Woman); False Prophet (the)]
|||Day||1. A measure of time denoting a 24-hour period, as in the literal seven days of the Creation
2. A measure of time spoken prophetically, denoting a literal year: "And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year (Ezekiel 4:6)." [see A Prophetic Day]
3. A measure of time spoken prophetically, denoting a thousand years: "But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day [is] with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day" (2 Peter 3:8). The LORD in Genesis 2:17 instructed Adam regarding the fruit of the forbidden tree, "for in the day that thou eatest thereof though shalt surely die". Adam died at the age of 930, showing that he had not completed the full day (1000 years) as God had stated. See also Psalm 90:4
4. A prophetic reference to an indefinite period of time or an era in the which certain events are to, or have occurred. For example: [Future] "In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will [God] appoint [for] walls and bulwarks." Isaiah 26:1. [Past] "These [are] the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens" Genesis 2:4
|||Day of Atonement (antitypical)||Time of investigative judgment where each person's case [commencing with the dead and then concluding with those who are alive], penned in a book of record is evaluated (Daniel 7:9-14; 8:14). The Budding Leaves of Spring mark the time, before the Summer Harvest and where the branches and twigs are broken-off (pruned). For the truly penitent who have continued in faith, trusting in the atoning blood of Christ, their sins will be blotted out and the garments of salvation placed upon them (Acts 3:19, 20; Zechariah 3:1-9). For the unjust, their sins will remain on record and their names, if once written in the Book of Life, will be blotted-out (Rev 3:5; Ezek 33:12-20; Matthew 18:23-35). [see Book of Life (the Lamb's) [Book of the Living]; Number #2300, Investigative Judgment]
|||Day of the Lord||The day of the Sunday Law, where Adventism's and the land that has held it [USA] probations are closed and will be judged (Genesis 15:14).
  - Ancient Israel's Day of the LORD was at the first Passover and at the Red Sea. Passover was the Close of Probation for the Hebrews (a door was shut and the people were judged, whether they obeyed the commands of God or not) as the Red Sea was the culmination of God's judgments upon Egypt, the land that held them captive 
  - Adventism's Day of the LORD is at the enforcement of the Sunday Law. Adventism's Close of Probation will be with the enforcement of the Sunday Law where all will be tried to see if they have received the moisture of the Latter Rains. Simultaneously, the USA's probation would have closed where national apostasy would lead to national ruin. The day of restitution; the series of prophetic events leading up to and including the Second Coming of Jesus Christ as King of Kings and Lord of Lords. A "woeful" time is this era where men are being tried and tested before the great Time of Trouble and great distress that will come upon the earth before the Lord's coming. (Malachi 3:2; Isaiah 2:12-18; 2Chronicles 9:21, 22; Psalm 48:7; Jeremiah 17:15-18; Joel 1:15; Matthew 22:1-9; Zephaniah 1:14-16; Ezekiel 30:2, 3). [see Investigative Judgment; Time of the End; Woes (three)]
|||Day of Small Things||An era of early beginnings where scorners mock the future success of a movement/endeavor but the righteous walk by faith, foreseeing the LORD's providence. The old men who saw Solomon's temple and saw the foundations laid for the new temple after 70yrs of Babylonian captivity wailed for its inferiority. They could not see God's rich blessings in restoring his people and therefore, despised the day of small things. Similarly, Adventists today regard the Millerite and early Advent movements as a failure of misguided individuals when in fact it was the greatest reform movement since Apostolic days. In despising the day of small things for Adventism, modern Adventists overlook the very history and experiences that are most crucial in understanding their present truths (Zechariah 4:10; Mark 4:30-32).
|||Days of Vengeance||A prophetic reference made by Jesus to the destruction of Jerusalem at the hands of Pagan Rome in 70AD (Luke 21:22; Daniel 9:26, 27) and the eventual treading down of the wicked by Himself at the end of time. God will destroy His enemies in His winepress, causing all of his garments to be stained red (Isaiah 63:2-5; Revelation 14:14-20, 19:11-13)
|||Day (Time/Year) of Visitation||Day of reckoning; the time when God pours out His wrath upon the unjust and wicked. (Isaiah 10:3; Jeremiah 8:12, 13, 10:14, 15, 11:21-23, 23:11, 12, 48:44; Hosea 9:7; Micah 7:4; 1 Peter 2:12)
|||Dead (in sin)||Term used to denote the spiritual condition of the wicked, unconverted, dead in sin (Ephesians 2:1). Condition requires repentance and a rebirth experience so that the person becomes dead to sin and alive in Christ. [see ? Dead (to sin)]
|||Dead (to sin)||term used to denote the spiritual condition of the righteous, alive in Christ and dead to the former life of sin (Romans 6:2-13; Galatians 2:16-20). Jesus gives life both to our mortal bodies and to our spiritual life. [see ? Dead (in sin)]
|||Deliver||To save, to sustain [within], to uphold, to preserve, to rescue [from] [see Escape]
|||Deaf/Deafness||[see Blindness/Deafness (Spiritual)]
|||Desire of Nations (The)||Jesus, as spoken of by God through the prophet Haggai. As the Israelites returned to Jerusalem to repair the temple of God, it was noted that the remodeled temple was far inferior to the majesty of the first temple. Yet, the Lord promises that the glory of the second would be yet far greater than the first because the Desire of Nations would fill it with His presence (Haggai 2:6-9)
|||Dew of Heaven||Blessings of the Lord upon the just and the unjust that waters the earth and brings the increase of the land; by it, all know that God reigns in heaven and on earth (Genesis 27:38, 39; Daniel 4:15, 25, 33; 5:21).
|||Desolators/Desolation||Those who tread down the people of God, His sanctuary, and profane the name of God. The desolators of God's people were typically used to punish God's people for their waywardness, so that they might repent of their sins and seek the Lord when He may be found (Psalm 78:34-39). The Desolators in their cruelty and pride, failed to acknowledge God as their hand of strength against His own people (Habakkuk 1:11; Deuteronomy 32:27), and through their ruthlessness, brought condemnation upon themselves so that they may be found wanting in judgment. The desolators into whose hands the Lord delivered His people include:
  - The Egyptians (Exodus 1-14) [Before Israel became a Nation, Egypt was its desolator]
  - The Canaanites (Judges 3:1-7, 4:1-3)
  - The Midianites, Amalekites and all the children of the East (Judges 6, 7:12)
  - The Philistines (Judges 13, 14)
  - The Assyrians (Lamentations 1:15, 2:2-5; Hosea 8:8, 9; Micah 5:8; Hosea 5:13, 14; Jeremiah50:17; Isaiah 7:18-20)
  - The Babylonians (Micah 5:8; Hosea 5:13, 14; Jeremiah 50:17)
  - The Medes & Persians (Daniel 8:13)
  - The Greeks (Daniel 8:13)
  - The Romans [ Pagan and Papal] (Daniel 8:13; Matt 24:15; Luke 21:12; Mark 13:9)
  - Modern Rome, the 10 Kings, the world (Isaiah 27:10, 11; )

The final desolators will be those who gather in the rebellious of God's last day remnant church to be burned, because they lacked understanding of God's Word, His promises, and His prophetic warnings so that they make preparations to be saved (Isaiah 27:10, 11). [see Abomination of Desolation, Hireling2; Lion (by the way);]
|||Distress of Nations||The experience of the nations of Europe and the World in 1839, 1840 when Egypt sought to take the remains of the Ottoman Empire by force and continue a lasting jihad against the nations of Europe through an alliance with the Arabs of Saudi Arabia. This distress of nations caused the four great nations of Europe (Austria, England, Prussia, Russia) to put a restraint on Islam, prophetically ending the Ottoman Empire on August 11, 1840. (Luke 21:25). The prophetic interpretation of this prophecy, given two years in advance by Josiah Litch gave power to the Adventist Movement (1st Angel's Message), giving credence to the authority of the Bible, the day-for-a-year Bible interpretation principle and the Advent Movement itself. This empowering is given by the angel descending in Revelation 10:1-4 with the Little Book of Daniel open. [see "Nations were Angry"]
|||Door (shut)||Symbolizing the end of a dispensation, or the end of a probationary period to be followed by the execution of judgment (Ezek 8:17, 18; Matthew 25:10-12; Rev 3:7; Rev 22:11)
|||Dragon||Satan/Devil/'Serpent of Old' manifesting himself throughout time through a plurality of hosts (Rev 12:7-11, 20:2; Genesis 3:1-5); 2[Red] Dragon (Red w/ 7heads, 10 horns & diadems on heads): Satan working through Paganism and Pagan Rome (Daniel 8:11; Matthew 2:13, 27:20, 24-26; Rev 12:2-4; 13:2); 3Dragon (Rev 16:13): Satan working through Spiritualism/New Age Movement, a rebirth of paganism; 4World political, civil leaders (kings, rulers and governors), and secret societies [plural] who will be drunken with the wine of the papacy in final events and will be overthrown. Their drunkenness will be manifest in promoting the Image to the Beast under a New World Order [see back of U.S. Dollar bill - pyramid of Egypt is a symbol of the world]. The Dragon power continues (the daily) even after the Beast and False Prophet are no more. One of the Dragon spirit's hallmarks is forced/coerced group conformity, and punishment for dissension. (Daniel 5:1-4; Rev 16:13, 17:12-18; 18:9-16; Revelation 19:20-20:3, 10). [see Daily (the); Beast from the Abyss; False Prophet; Modern Egypt; Greek, Latin and Hebrew; Number #102]
|||Dragon, Beast and False Prophet||A threefold union or confederacy of demonic powers that constitute Modern Babylon, forming a counterfeit trinity that wars against God and His people. Always appearing in the noted order, the counterfeit trinity is said to spew out unclean spirits upon the earth as frogs that go to deceive the earth and prepare them for the final battle of Armageddon (Revelation 16:13, 14). The counterfeit trinity is prophetically foreshadowed throughout the Bible in the following:
  1. The three forces that opposed the Children of Israel in the wilderness: Balak the Moabite, the Midianites, Balaam the Prophet
  2. The three forces that opposed Solomon: Hadad, Rezon, Jeroboam
  3. The three forces that overthrew the Man of God sent from Judah: [see Lion (by the way), Ass by the way, False Prophet (the), Man of God]
  4. The three forces that warred against Elijah: Ahab, Jezebel, 430 Prophets of Baal
  5. The three forces that warred against Nehemiah: Tobiah, Sanballat, Geshew the Arab
  6. The three forces that were blasphemously worshipped by Israel through the worship of Sun, Moon and Stars
  7. The three forces that warred against John the Baptist: Salome, Herodias, Herod
  8. The three world forces that warred against Christ: The popular Greek culture, Rome, Apostate Judaism [see Greek, Latin and Hebrew]
  9. The three forces that war against the 144,000: Dragon/Spiritualism, Modern Rome, Apostate Protestantism [see Three Unclean Spirits]
|||Drink of the Cup||To take on, bear upon oneself, to endure, usually of punishment. The Lord has a cup whose wine is red and full of mixture that is to be poured out in His wrath for all the sons of disobedience to partake. Jesus drank from this cup on the cross for the sins of the world so that no man need drink of it. (Psalm 75:8; Isaiah 51:22; Jeremiah 25:15, 25:28, 49:12; Matthew 20:22; Revelation 14:19, 20). [Cup (of God's wrath); Wrath of God]
|||Drink the waters||The take in the doctrine, to be a partaker of or participant in certain works, whether good or bad (Jeremiah 2:17-19).
|||Drunk (to be)||To be deceived; to be intoxicated; to have partaken of Old Wine, fallen away from the old paths and to have made crooked paths such that there is no understanding or willingness to observe the prophetic word and present truth message that they may have peace in God (Isaiah 59:8-15). The Bible counsels the saints to be sober, vigilant, watching and praying because our adversary walks about as a lion, seeking whom he may destroy. (Proverbs 20:1; 23:31, 32; Jeremiah 13:12-14; Rev 17:6; 18:23; Joel 1:1-5; 1 Peter 5:8). [see Babbler, Wine (Old)]
|||Drunkards of Ephraim||The leadership of the Nation of Israel (kings, princes, priests and prophets), referred to as the "crown of pride" who are overcome [made drunk] by wine, or false doctrine. A prophetic allusion to the leadership of the Seventh-day Adventist Church at the end of the world, many of whom will fall away from the old paths and will seek to promote the deceptive wine of Babylon after having drunk of it. These same falter in vision, cannot receive the increase of knowledge and understanding of the prophetic word because they've drunken deep of falsehood and serve as examples to the masses, who too have forsaken the old paths and cannot discern truth nor the prophetic word (Isaiah 28:1, 7-11, 14, 29:9-14; Hosea 7:1-16; Habakkuk 1:5-7; 1 Kings 18:21). [see Watchmen (Blind); Jerusalem; Head and Tail, Branch and Rush]
|||Eagle||Speed, power, vision, vengeance, protection (Deut 28:49; Job 9:26; Rev 12:14); 2a symbol for Babylon (Papal/Modern Rome) (Deuteronomy 28:49, Job 39:27-30; Obadiah 1:3, 4)
|||Early (Former) Rain||The First rains, seedtime rains to give life to the seed (Deuteronomy 11:13-14; Joel 2:23); The Apostles received the Holy Spirit in measure when Christ breathed upon them (John 7:39, 20:22) but without measure at Pentecost when they corporately received power from the Holy Spirit to minister to the entire world (John 4:31-38; Acts 1:5, 8; 2). The Millerite's Early Rain experience occurred in 1840 when the Holy Spirit first empowered their message, then followed with power in the Spring of 1844 when the Midnight Cry message was taken to the world. Pentecost for the church body is symbolic of the Early Rain experience to be followed by an End Time Latter Rain experience. Everyone, however, must experience the Early Rains in their own personal Christian walk, namely, accepting Christ as your personal Savior daily, eating of His book, and allowing Him to transform your character. [see Budding Leaves of Spring]
|||Ear, Thumb, Toe (Right)||Aaron and his sons, when anointed priests over the houses of Israel, had blood applied to their right ear, their right thumb, and their right large toe, symbolizing that where ever they walk should be consecrated by the Lord, whatever they do with their hands should be consecrated to the Lord and all that they hear should be consecrated to the Lord. The right side symbolized favor with God (see Zechariah 3:1). As priests of God, we are to, like the sons of Aaron, have our works, our walk, and our thoughts, and what we hear consecrated to the Lord (Exodus 29:20; Leviticus 8:23, 24) [see Hand (Right)]
|||Earth||Opposite of Waters/Seas, a sparsely populated area or region of the earth (Rev 10:2; 12:16; 13:11)
|||Earthquake||an upheaval on the earth spiritually denoting a war or revolution (Revelation 11:13). [see Tenth Part of the City]
|||East||1. Direction in which Cain departs from the presence of the Lord, becoming the father of sun worship and spiritualism (Genesis 4:16). Direction in which the sun rises and direction where the heathen/pagans worship in honor of the sun (Ezekiel 8:16); Direction from which the people of God are empowered (replenished) with soothsaying (Spiritualism).
2. Direction from which the Sun of Righteousness (Jesus) will come (2nd Coming) with hea His wings (Isaiah 41:2-4, 51:19; Malachi 4:2; Ezekiel 43:1-4; 44:4-6).
|||East Wind||that which brings about famine or an economic collapse (Genesis 41:6, 7, 27; Psalm 48:7; Exodus 10:12-15; Ezekiel 19:12; Hosea 13:15), making way for a One World Government (Genesis 41:5-57). A prophetic allusion to Islam at the end of the world which like the east wind borne locusts of the sixth plague of Egypt, covers the earth and breaks the economic strength (the Ships of Tarshish) of the world [Egypt] (Ezekiel 27:24-27, Isaiah 27:8). Once these East Winds have blown, the Rough Winds (Four Winds of Strife) will be released [see Islam, Kedar (sons of), "Nations were Angry", Children of the East, Ships of Tarshish, Winds (Holding the four), Woes (three); Hireling] "Eaten Upon the Mountains" = a phrase referring to the abominable acts of worship including lewd sensual acts, sacrificing to idols and sacrificing one's own children upon the high places (Ezekiel 18:6, 11, 12, 15, 22:9-11). [see High Places, Groves, Alters]
|||Eating the Little Book||The comprehension of present truth and glad reception of the bittersweet message found within the Bible, but especially the little book of Daniel for the end time Remnant. John the Revelator, in eating the little book enacts the experience of the Millerite Movement, but even more so, the experience of the 144,000, who unlike the Millerites, have understanding of the associated bitter-sweet experience (they are forewarned of the experience to come) and yet eat the book and prophecy again. (Ezekiel 3:1-14; Revelation 10:8-11; contrast Isaiah 30:8-11; Jeremiah 15:11, 15-21) [see Book, The Little; Bitter/Sweet (Taste); Reform Movements]
|||Ecumenical Movement||The boast of the harlot church that she would be no widow nor suffer loss of children, a movement founded by the Church of Rome to reclaim/gather through subtlety (wine of her doctrine) the children [churches] lost by the Protestant Reformation (Isaiah 47:5, 8; Revelation 18:7).[see Wine (of Fornication); False Prophet]
|||Edom||Name given to first born of Isaac, Esau. Distant cousins to the Israelites who have knowledge of the true God but do not heed his commandments, pervert His truths, and are idolaters [spiritual fornicators] (Ezekiel 25:12-14). [see Ammonite, Moabite]
|||Edom, Moab & Ammon||Edom (Esau - Gen 25:30, Hebrews 12:14-17) was brother of Jacob/Israel(Gen 32:28); Moab & Ammon were descendents of Lot (sons [grandsons] born of wine and fornication (incest) - Gen19:31-38) - 3 close descendents of Israel who persecute Israel (Zephaniah 2:8, 9), committed spiritual fornication (unlawful relationship) and were opposed to the God of Israel (Numb 22-24; 1 Kings 11:1, 2) - spiritually, those who will come out of Babylon through the gospel (Eph 3:1-6) during the Loud Cry before Christ's 2nd Coming. When the King of the North is stretching out his hands across the nations through the universal Sunday Law, those in Edom, Ammon and Moab shall obey the remnant of God's people and escape (Jeremiah 9:25, 26; Rev 18:5; Dan 11:41; Isaiah 11:10-14; Luke 17:29, 30; John 10:16) [see Loud Cry, Wine, Fornication]
|||Egypt (Land of)||A place of refuge when being sought by persecutors for Hadad the Edomite, Jeroboam the Ephrathite and for Jesus Christ (1 Kings 11:17, 40, Matthew 2:13); often a symbol of bondage (Exodus 16:1, 3; 20:1; Galatians 4:30); geographically south of Palestine, known as the Southern Kingdom ruled by the King of the South (Daniel 11). Historically, Egypt was subdued by order of God, by the Lord's hireling, the King of the North, Babylon (Isa 20:1-4; Jeremiah 46). Spiritually, Egypt is a symbol of the world (Galatians 4:3, Daniel 11:42; Hebrews 11:23-26)) as well as one representation in time of the Beast from the Bottomless Pit (Rev 11:7) which is a symbol of a plurality of powers: atheism (Ex 5:2), paganism, and modern paganism (Spiritualism embodied in the New Age Movement) that will engulf the world in the last days. Egypt is alluded to as a "great dragon" who proudly and boastfully claims to have made the rivers he dwells in (Ezekiel 29:3-5), a symbol of the plural end-time portion of the counterfeit trinity that is given into the hand of Babylon the Great [King of the North - Papacy] (Ezekiel 29:17-20). Alexandria was a principle educational site for the spreading of paganism. Ancient Gnosticism originated in Alexandria from where the Sadducees adopted the false doctrine of an immortal soul and further that there was no resurrection but that the dead went straight to heaven to abide in the "bosom of Abraham" (Luke 16:22, 23; 20:27). The last day church, like ancient Israel will enter into covenant with Spiritual Egypt, the world causing it to fall away from the God of living waters (Jeremiah 2:5-18) [see Prison, Modern Egypt, Bottomless Pit, Dragon, ? King of the North]
|||Elam||One of the sons of Shem, Noah's son, who was the forefather of the Persians. Elam and Media were the conquerors of Babylon and Elam would be scattered to the four corners of the earth by the four Generals of Greece under Alexander the Great (Jeremiah 49:34-38; Daniel 8:2)
|||Elder||Also called a Bishop, is a spiritual leader in the church of God who as part of the body of God plays a critical part in organizing, coordinating, teaching, preaching, baptizing, evangelizing, and setting a good example for the other members of the body of Christ. By God's counsel given to Paul, the Elder was to be a male who demonstrated Christ-like ruler-ship over himself and his home and therefore capable of officiating over the house of God. The Apostles each served as the first Elders to the Christian Church and with the death of Judas another person, Matthias, demonstrating comparable qualities as the other disciples/apostles, was appointed. There was no hierarchy among the elders, nor among any other role within the church given that all were part of the body of Christ and Jesus Himself is the Head and the pattern by which all should follow. Yet, God understood the significance of leadership and stated that a dutiful elder should receive double honor for his faithfulness. The elders were to give themselves to prayer, studying, teaching, and ministering the gospel, raising up churches and shepherding flocks while training others in the ministry. Complimented by Deacons, who similarly were God fearing men, the Deacons managed much of the tactical, and hands-on responsibilities of the church including visitation for members, ensuring each member of the body was empowered and that their needs were met. (Acts 1:18-20, 6:1-4; 1 Corinthians 3:1-9; Ephesians 4:15, 16; 1 Timothy 2:8-3:7, 5:17-22)
|||Elijah (Elias)||Prophet of God whose life and works typify and prefigure the experience of the 144,000 in the last days. Elijah's message, spoken with power and signs from the Holy Spirit, was of reformation to the wayward Children of Israel and condemnation to the apostate Jewish King, Ahab, his controlling, and murderous wife Jezebel, and her 430 prophets to foreign gods (Baal) that led God's people into apostasy. The threefold union of Ahab, Jezebel, and the prophets of Baal typify the threefold union of Dragon, Beast and False Prophet that will oppose the people of God in the last days. Keystones of Elijah's message for the 144,000 include:
  1. A message directed to the lost sheep of Israel [a message to last day Adventism] (1 Kings 16:29-17:1; Matthew 10:5-20)
  2. Speaking a prophetic warning of famine for 3.5yrs [teaching of the 1,260yrs of Spiritual Darkness] (1 Kings 17:1-3; Haggai 1:1-11)
  3. Illustrating perseverance during a time of [spiritual] drought (1 Kings 17:4-24; Isaiah 58:10, 11)
  4. A gospel messenger to the Gentiles as he brings salvation, hope and a knowledge of the true God to the Zidonian widow of Zarephath (1 Kings 17:9-24)
  5. Bringing a message of conviction, directing the people to cease from wavering and decide to worship the true God [1st Angel's Message] (1 Kings 18:21)
  6. Exposing the false gods, false priests, prophets, and false worship of the time [2nd Angel's Message] (1 Kings 18:22-29)
  7. Participating in the gathering of God's people (1 Kings 18:19, 30; Zephaniah 2:1, 2)
  8. Rebuilding of the alter of the Lord [the old waste places and paths to dwell in] (1 Kings 18:31, 32; Isaiah 58:12-14; Haggai 1, 2)
  9. Calls on the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in order that He might be glorified [1st Angel's Message] (1 Kings 18:36, 37; Revelation 14:6, 7)
  10. Seeks to turn the hearts of the people back to the true God [1st, 2nd, 3rd Angel's Message] (1 Kings 18:37)

Elijah is also one who heralds the coming of the Kingdom of God with power in the time of Christ, and for His Second Coming (Mark 9:1-9; Isaiah 40:3-5; Revelation 1:7). Elijah, who never tasted death but being translated alive into heaven, foreshadows the group of people who neither will taste death but will be translated alive into heaven at the Second Coming of Christ. The Elijah message in its content and form is a prophetic message of reform that is repeated through several other "Elijah types" in Bible history namely: King Josiah (2 Kings 22), John the Baptist (Mark 9:11-13; Matthew 11:7-15); William Miller (Isaiah 58:11, 12; Malachi 3:1); and the 144,000 (Isaiah 40:3-5, 58:11, 12; Malachi 3:1, 4:5, 6; Revelation 14:6-12, 18:1-4). [see Dragon, Beast and False Prophet; Moses; Number #144,000; Rebuilding the Alter of the Lord; Zidon]
|||Ensign||A sign, symbol, banner, or token of God's authority. That to which people are gathered to/under. Jesus Himself is the true ensign of the Lord to whom the people are to stand under and the Gentiles seek (Isaiah 11:10). The Sabbath is the ensign for worship of the true God throughout time (Ezekiel 20:12) and especially at the end of the world. All will be gathered to God under this ensign. In the day when the Image to the Beast is set-up, God's ensign (the 10 Commandments and God's faithful Sabbath-keeping people) will be lifted up on the earth for all to see (Numbers 2:2; Isaiah 5:26; 11:10-12; 18:3, 4, 55:4, 5, 12, 13; Zechariah 9:16; Malachi 3:17, 18). [see Gather, Sabbath (the), Seal (of God), Wave Loaves, Jewels (God's)]
|||Ephesus||The 1st of seven prophetic churches described in the Revelation, denoting a particular era of the Christian Church history. The Apostolic and triumphant church that was born of Christ's apostles taking the gospel to the ends of the earth (31AD~100AD). Ephesus was a city of approximately 250,000 and was considered a marketplace of Asia. People flocked to Ephesus to buy fine silk, rare jewels, spices, hand-woven carpets, exquisite art objects and exotic foods. Ephesus was also the center for the worship of the pagan goddess Diana and the future home of the famed Celsus Library, with 12,000 volumes. Sexual promiscuity was commonplace yet; the church was noted to be a discerning church and one that had tirelessly labored for the gospel. Christ, however, offers loving rebuke as some in the church have adopted some of the false teachings and doctrines of false prophets, of whom the church was warned by Paul and Luke (1 Timothy 4:1-5; Acts 20:27-32). (Revelation 2:1-7). [see Smyrna]
|||Escape||To be delivered from error, falsehood, corruptions of the world or the powers themselves that corrupt (Daniel 11:41, 42; 2 Peter 2:18-20; 2 Peter 1:4) [see Deliver]
|||Ethiopia||A fertile and mineral rich land symbolizing wealth or the wealthy (Gen 2:10-13; Acts 8:27; Daniel 11:43); A careless people, the wealthy (Ezekiel 30:9); Armies of the wealthy nations (Jeremiah 46:9) [see Libya]
|||Euphrates||The river that first appears in the Garden of Eden and is later the source of prosperity for the Kingdom of Babylon. The Euphrates which served to make fertile the land of Shinar is used by Satan to counterfeit the River of Life which runs through the celestial city, the capital of God's government. The drying up of the Euphrates under the 6th Plague from the Lord, symbolizing the drying up of the resources and power that sustains the kingdom of Spiritual Babylon, prepares for the kings of the east to come forth. The work of the 6th plague is to be countered by Satan through the frogs that come forth from the mouth of the Dragon, Beast and False Prophet. (Revelation 16:12-14)
|||Exegesis||[see Hermeneutics]
|||Eyes (The)||Wisdom, insight; one's gaze often reveals the intent of the heart (Psalm 32:8; Daniel 7:8; 11:30, 31; Mark 9:47). [see Heart (The)]
|||Eyes (darkened/evil)||To be deluded, confounded, deceived; no longer perceiving the light of God's glory. (Psalm 69:23, Matthew 6:22, 23; Romans 11:7-10)
|||Eyes (single)||singularly focused (on God), not double or complicated (Matthew 6:22). The eyes are to reflect the light of God to our minds so we may become as He is; behold Him in His glory, high and lifted up, which is a safeguard for pride and self-righteousness.
|||Eyesalve||Clear spiritual insight given by the Holy Spirit that declares Jesus as Lord and purges one of his sins (John 16:8-14; 9:6, 11, 25, 27, 30-33, 35-38; Revelation 3:18). [see White Robes (Raiment); Gold (tried in fire)]
|||Faith of Jesus||Righteousness by Faith; Christ in you, the hope of glory. The faith that Christ imparts to us that is united with His faith (faith to faith) that enables us to live victorious lives in the present age (Romans 3:20-22, Titus 2:11-15; 1 John 5:4); the blessed hope and confidence [patience] of those who have been justified by believing in the unmerited works of Christ [the just shall live by faith] and what He has and will accomplish in them (Romans 4:17-22; Revelation 14: 12; Colossians 1:27; Galatians 2:20; Romans 1:17, 4:4-8). [see Righteousness by Faith]
|||Fall/Fallen/Fallen Away||1. To apostatize, to turn one's back on God and on the paths of righteousness; to forsake truth and cast truth to the ground; disobedience/rebellion. Only the works of repentance and returning to the Old Paths (the law and commandments of God) will restore one in such a condition lest they be overthrown. (Isaiah 3:8, 14:12, 59:14; Ezekiel 8:14-17; Daniel 8:12; Hosea 14:1, 2; Galatians 5:4; 2 Thessalonians 2:3-12; 2 Peter 2:21, 22; Revelation 2:5, 14:8). [see ? Path of the Just / Paths to Dwell in]
2. To be spoiled, ruined, killed, destroyed, or overcome (Jeremiah 50:15, 51:8, 9; Lamentations 2:21). [see Overthrown]
|||False Prophet (the)||Jewish leaders in the time of Christ who, rather than hailing their King, Jesus, killed Him. These were responsible for inciting the people [the Dragon power] to put Jesus to death (Matthew 27:20); spiritually, apostate Protestantism which rather than hailing and promoting its original tenets of sola scriptura and sola Christos (scripture alone and Christ alone), side with God's enemy in the creation of an Image to the Beast (Luke 23:35; Revelation 16:13). The False Prophets have always been ones who receive their message and counsel from Satan to deceive the people of God, lulling them into a state of complacency (1 Kings 22-20-23). The message of the False Prophets are "peace and safety" though sudden destruction is soon to occur (1 Thessalonians 5:1-3). These are they who device cunning winds of doctrine to deceive men. The deceptions cause men to reject the message of God's watchmen and to reject the old paths (Jeremiah 14:13-15; 6:8-24) The False Prophets within Adventism proclaim peace and safety though the close of probation is soon to befall at the coming of the Sunday Law. (Ephesians 4:14; Galatians 6:12, 13) [see "Peace and Safety"; Daughters of Babylon; Synagogue of Satan; Tares; Beast (lamb-like); Dragon; Greek, Latin and Hebrew, ? Protestantism; ? Ways and Old Paths (Walk ye in the)]
|||Fat (of a sacrifice)||Sins or sins being consumed on the alter of sacrifice (Leviticus 3:16, 17, 17:6)
|||Fat/Fattest||The choicest, the best, richest, most prosperous [land] (Isaiah 28:1; Genesis 41:17-31, 45:18; Numbers 13:20); that which God intends for His people to enjoy corporately, that is hoarded by the wicked and those in power (Deuteronomy 31:20).
|||Fierce Countenance||A description given prophetically of the iron nation whose tongue could not be discerned, that would besiege the land given by God, toppling the high walls, and would oppress those who were once a people of God; the Roman Empire (Deuteronomy 28:45-52; Daniel 8:23). [see Dark Sentences]
|||Fig (Two Baskets of)||Prophetic parable given to the prophet Jeremiah regarding the fate of the Nation of Israel at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar. The one basket filled with very good figs, like those that are first ripe, represent those who would be taken captive to Babylon, watched over by the Lord and preserved until He gathered them from the North Country. The very naughty, so bad that they could not be eaten basket of figs represented those who were deceived by the false prophets, pastors and teachers who prophesied not by God, and thought to remain in Jerusalem and fight against the Babylonians. Their plight as given by the Lord was to be the sword, famine, and pestilence every where they were scattered until they were consumed. This parable foreshadows the eventual permanent destruction of Israel in 70AD and the plight of the Christians and Jews respectively. Lastly, the parable describes the eventual plight of the just and unjust at the end of time (Jeremiah 24; 23; 29:15-19). [see North; Head and Tail, Branch and Rush]
|||Fig Tree||Early blooming tree compared to other trees (Luke 21:29-33), prophetically symbolizing present truth (the gospel and knowledge of end time truths and events) entrusted to the Remnant Church, long before leaves are borne on other trees that too, must in time come to maturity, bearing leaves and fruit. The fig tree is caused to bud by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit (Joel 2:23-32) by the latter rain. The fig tree is to bloom and give forth its fruit in early spring, before summer [the time of harvest]. Yet Christ in a parallel parable (prophecy) pronounced a curse upon the (former) fig tree (Nation of Israel) which had pretentious leaves but bore no fruit (Matt 21:18, 19, 3:1-10). In this case, the Fig Tree may also represent the church or an independent ministry (Micah 4:4). Nathaniel was found sitting under a fig tree when called by Phillip to come see Jesus. Because of John the Baptist's ministry, of which Nathaniel was a part (a disciple of John) he was not prejudiced to follow Jesus. [see Summer, Times ofRefreshing]
|||Fine White Linen||Christ's Righteousness (Matthew 22:11-14; Revelation 6:9-11; 16:15); righteous acts of the saints (Rev 3:18, 19:8, 14, 4:4, 7:9, 6:10, 11; Zech 3:1-5)
|||Fire||A symbol of the presence of the true God (Exodus 3:1-6 Deuteronomy 4:24; 1 Kings 18; Daniel 7:9; Luke 3:16; 12:49; Hebrews 12:9); the Holy Spirit's fire is the "spirit of burning" that purifies and purges the sins of men (Zechariah 13:8, 9). To sin, God is a consuming fire (Isaiah 4:4; Hebrews 12:29). a testing agent and a purifying agent; used to reveal one's true character and one's works, whether they be of Christ or the enemy (1 Corinthians 3:9-15; Daniel 3:22-30; Mark 9:49); trials and tests (1 Peter 1:7; 4:12-16)
|||Fire (God's)||The Holy Spirit Himself, who baptizes those who accept Christ with His abiding presence in their lives (John 1:33, 3:5-8, 4:24; Acts 2:38, 10:45-48). The fire of God is holy and sacred and originates from Him and is sent down from heaven. This sacred fire was to be used for holy purposes within the sanctuary of God and was to be kept burning continually, symbolizing the continual presence of God with us and in our lives, which purges us of sin and purifies us so we become a reflection of Jesus Christ. Fire from God is the work of the Holy Spirit who purifies the sons of Jacob (Matt 3:11; Acts 2:3). The fire of God has a twofold effect: 1it is used in purifying/purge the Sons of God of sin which is combustible and develop a character marked by the fruit of the Spirit including obedience, faithfulness, patience, love. This purification process requires tests and trials to perfect our character (Isaiah 43:2; Zechariah 3:2; Malachi 3:2, 3; 4:1, 3; Mark 9:49); and 2used to consume the wicked who hold onto sin in their lives (Malachi 4:1, 3; Mark 9:49). The spiritual fire of God from the Holy Spirit, as given at Pentecost and with the Latter Rain during the Time of the End, completes the work of refining a people to become holy as God is Holy, without spot or wrinkle (Ephesians 5:27; 1 Peter 1:1-4), to meet Jesus at His Second Coming in peace (Genesis 15:17; 22:6; Exodus 3:1-6; Acts 2). [see Fire; Purge/Purify; Pentecost; Latter Rain]
|||Fire (Strange)||Unconsecrated fire, not originating from God; that which was offered profanely by the sons of Aaron that led to their instant death (Leviticus 10:1-3). Strange fire is a counterfeit fire that originates from men's works and not God's works and has pagan/satanic origins; strange spiritual fire similarly is of demonic origin and provides the appearance of godly revival but is merely an outward manifestation that does not bring about the necessary change in character. Strange spiritual fire is manifested by demonic forces that play upon the emotions, affections, and senses of men, creating an appearance and feelings of God's presence but yielding no heart conversion that results in obedience to God and purity of life (1 Kings 18:25-29; Acts 16:16-19; 2 Thessalonians 2:9, 10; Revelation 13:3, 4, 13; 16:13-14). [see Music (Unrighteous, Unholy); Spiritualism]
|||Fire & Brimstone||Denoting judgment; The Second Death found in the Lake of Fire, reserved for the Devil and his angels and those who have rejected Jesus' substitutionary death for the world (Rev 14:10, 21:7) [see Woes (three)2]
|||Fire or Water||Two elements used to describe the Holy Spirit.
|||Firstfruit||A symbol of the best and first being offered to God, like a tithe and the First Born. The sheaf offering of barley, the first of the cultivated harvest, presented on the 16th day of the 1st month was an offering of faith in God's provision over the people, a symbol of worship that the first is being offered to God, and a promise of future blessings, that God would continue to provide a bountiful harvest season to sustain His people. The First Fruit of the resurrection is Jesus Himself, who was given as an offering, showing God's provision for man's sin; an example of true and godly worship for all to follow; and through His death offers a promise that others would share in His resurrection and work of redemption. Types of the First Fruit of redemption are seen in Elijah and Moses who represent the redeemed who will inherit eternal life. Elijah never saw death whereas Moses died and was resurrected by Jesus Himself (Jude 9), thus symbolizing the two types of fruit of redemption. Similarly, those whose graves were opened at Christ's death and who came forth from the grave at Christ's resurrection, walked the earth with Christ for 40 days and ascended with Him after the 40 days typify the First Fruit of redemption that saw death and are resurrected. Lastly, the 144,000 represent the First Fruit of redemption that will never see death but are translated to heaven, bearing the Father's name on their forehead, the name of New Jerusalem, and the name given to them by Christ (Exodus 23:16; Leviticus 23:9-14; Matthew 16:28-17:9; Matthew 27:50-53; Revelation 14:4). [see First Born, Number #144,000, Wave Loaves]
|||First Born (child/animal)||Ones who are consecrated to God (first fruit), inheritors of the birthright, priests of the family; a representation of Jesus who is the Firstborn of the Holy Spirit, Firstborn of the grave, and Firstborn over all creation as He is heir of God's great Kingdom [the 2nd Adam] (Luke 2:23; Numbers 3:40-51; Colossians 1:12-15; Hebrews 1:1, 2).[see Firstfruit]
|||First End of the Indignation||A term derived deductively from its counterpart, the Last End of the Indignation (Daniel 8:19). The conclusion of the first time of scattering in A.D.1798, a period lasting seven-times (2520 years) determined upon the Nation of Israel and foretold in the prophecies of Moses (Leviticus 26). The commencement of the first time of scattering was marked by the collapse and scattering of the Northern Kingdom of Israel (Ephraim/Samaria) in 723B.C. by the Assyrians (King of the North). The First End of the Indignation signals the restoration of God's host, His people who had been trodden down by their enemies (Daniel 8:13). Through their adversary's destruction/captivity at an appointed time, the host was restored (Isaiah 10:24, 25; Daniel 11:36, 12:7). [see Indignation (the Lord's); Last End of the Indignation]
|||Flock of Slaughter||those who are led and influenced by the three shepherds of Dragon, Beast and False Prophet whom the Lord will slay in one month. The House of Israel who were once led by God's staff of Beauty but due to their rebellion, God would forsake His covenant to them and would lead them by the staff of Bands. Those among the flock who chose to follow God recognized God's words to be true but those who forsook them are led into the hands of the Idol Shepherd who will cause them to perish (Zechariah 11:3-17). [see Shepherd (Idol)]
|||Flood||A besiegement as by an army (Isaiah 8:7, 8, 59:19; Jeremiah 47:2-4; Daniel 9:26; Revelation 12:15, 16); A symbol of the desolations of the Papacy specifically upon the people of God during the Dark Ages and at the End of Time; a deluge of unbiblical doctrine (Revelation 12:13-16, Isaiah 28:17, 18); he who comes in like a flood to destroy and overflow is Rome; Jesus gave a prophetic allusion to the Papacy who, during the time of the rains (Latter Rain) will come with the winds of strife to beat against the wall of every man's house [through the Sunday Law] to see if it stand (Daniel 9:26, Revelation 12:13-16, Matt 7:24-27; Isaiah 25:4) [see Overflow]
|||Fly of Egypt||the Egyptian armies that would besiege Israel and Judah as part of the punishment the Lord brought upon His wayward sons (Isaiah 7:17, 18). [see Bee of Assyria]
|||Foolish (the)/Wicked (the)||Those who hear but do not keep the sayings of Jesus Christ; those who build their house on the sand (Matthew 7:26, 27); those who take no oil in their lamps and are unprepared for the coming of the bridegroom (Matthew 25:1-13); those who say in their heart "my Lord delayeth his coming" and do wickedly, lacking understanding of last day events and are overthrown (Matthew 24:48-51; Daniel 12:10); those who make no use of the talents/gifts/opportunities being given them to invest them in the Kingdom of God (Matthew 25:24-30); those who fast for debate and strife and make a pretense of their religious faith (Isaiah 58:1-4); those who refuse to read and search for understanding the book to the saving of their lives (Isaiah 29:9-13). Those who know of the Latter Rain truths hidden in Daniel 11:40-45 but make no effort to understand and allow the message to do the work of purifying, making white, and enlightening their understanding. In the time of harvest, when there is a famine for the Word of God, when God no longer passes by the sins of His people, these will go searching these same verses for truth but will not find any (Amos 8:11-14, 1, 2; Micah 7:18, 19) [see Tares, Briers and Thorns, Leaves (only), Overthrown, ? Wise (the)]
|||Forehead||The place where one's reasoning and thoughts are processed. The mind which demonstrates one's character (thoughts and feelings) was created to have preeminence over the body and lustful desires. Only with the refining power of the Holy Spirit can a person once again die to flesh so that the Spirit of God may have control over the thoughts, feelings, and emotions. The frontal lobe of the brain [cerebral cortex] is guarded by some of the densest bones in the body found in the forehead, yet it is easily penetrable as we yield ourselves to sin. God desires to place His seal in our foreheads and write His name upon them so that we bear His character. Similarly, the devil seeks to place his mark [Mark of the Beast] on our foreheads or hands to show his ownership of our lives. The choice is ours who we will serve. [see Heart (the), Hands]
|||Forehead (Whore's)||A rebellious, perverted mind (Jeremiah 3:3)
|||Former Rain||Early Rains from God which bring initial life and growth to sown seeds (Jeremiah 5:24). Spiritually, when a person is first converted and accepts Christ as their personal Savior, the Holy Spirit is given as a gift (Acts 2:38) to guide and lead them into all truth (John 16:13). Prophetically, the Former Rains for the Christian Church were given when the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles to begin their work of ministry (Acts 1:8; 2-5; Joel 2:23). [see Latter Rain, Pentecost]
|||Fornication||An illicit relationship; unification of church and state (statecraft + church-craft) forming an illicit relationship; the harlot women (false church) sitting on the beast (world government) symbolizes this fornication. This relationship is entered into with subtlety and through deception (intoxicating wine) on the part of the woman (the church) that rides upon the beast (kings and merchants of the world). (Luke 20:20; 21:10-12; Rev 14:8, 17:3-6; 18:3, 9). [see Wine (of Wrath of Fornication)]
|||Foundations||Biblical truths that are principle in establishing the faith of God's people. God has established foundational truths over time that are to be understood, gathered, reviewed and upheld by the believers. God's remnant of the last days are said to "raise up the foundations of many generations", implying they are to search, uncover and restore the foundations that have become obscured through neglect, apostacy and the introduction of heresies (doctrines of men).
|||Fountain for Sin and Uncleanness||the fountain for which Christ spoke to the woman at the well saying "whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life". The fountain of life that takes away sin and uncleanness is nothing more than the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed for the remission of sins. Zechariah foretold this fountain for the Spiritual house of Israel and the blood from the fountain will never lose its power to save for those who believe. Equally relevant, the waters from the fountain are those [doctrine/teachings] which testify of Jesus Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit that leads men to repentance unto eternal life. (Zechariah 13:1; John 4:13; 14). [see Water; Water (of life); Living Waters (Springs of); Latter Rain, Former Rain, Times of Refreshing;]
|||Fourth Generation||The prophecy spoken by Joel was to be repeated to four generations. These four generations are typified by periods or eras given by four destroying creatures (palmerworm, locust, cankerworm, and caterpillar) (Joel 1:1-4). God promises to restore the years that the destroying creatures were among His people. God will restore things as they were in the first generation. This prophecy speaks of four generations of Adventism from its inception in 1844 [the Church of Philadelphia], that God in the end will restore (Joel 2:18-32). This era is called the Times of Restitution (Acts 3:19-21). The Lord also chronicles in the establishment of the Jewish Nation, four generations after Abraham, God would restore Abraham's descendents to the land promised him (Genesis 15:13-16) [see Times of Restitution (of all things)]
|||Frogs||considered sacred and worshipped by the ancient Egyptians; a detestable creature that typifies the foul spiritual forces of deception that covers the land, issuing from the mouth of the counterfeit trinity: Dragon, Beast, and False Prophet (Revelation 16:13).
|||Fruit||1one's works that one bears. The acts and actions that reveal the counsels and purposes of the heart. The wise or righteous receive the Early and Latter Rains and bear fruit unto righteousness (2 Peter 1:5-8). Only God can discern the motives for works done (2 Kings 19:30; Ezekiel 17:8; Matthew 3:8, 10; John 15:4-8).
|||Fruit of the Vine||Grapes/Grape Juice; a symbol of ease, peace, rest, and contentment. Jesus will not drink of the Fruit of the Vine until we are at ease/peace/rest/contentment with Him in the Eternal Kingdom (Luke 22:16-18).
|||Fruit (of the Womb)||Offspring; one's heirs (Hosea 9:16). [see 2Seed]
|||Full (Cup)||the end of a probationary period where one's sins that had been amassed are to be judged (Genesis 15:13-1; 2 Thessalonians 2:14-16; Revelation 17:4, 5).
|||Garland of 12 Stars||12 Apostles of Christ (Rev 12:1, Daniel 12:3) or 12 tribes of Israel (Rev 7:5-8); God's called emissaries of the gospel whose teachings were built upon the foundations of many generations (Isaiah 58:12), the Chief Cornerstone being Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 3:11; Matthew 7:24; 1 Peter 2:6-8)
|||Garments||One's character, comprised of the way one feels and how one thinks.
|||Garments (whitened)/ (New)||Christ's robe of righteousness that covers our sins unlike our filthy rags of self-righteousness that leaves us naked (Rev 16:15; 3:18; Matthew 9:10-17, 22:9-14; Luke 5:36; Malachi 3:2, 3); garments of salvation made available and given by the Great King (Isaiah 61:10, Matthew 22:7-13). [see Wine (New)]
|||Garments (filthy rags)/(Old)||Strange or foreign garments indicative of worshipping strange or foreign gods (2 Kings 10:16-28; Matthew 22:11, 12; Zephaniah 1:8); false/self righteousness used to cover one's sins/idols (Isaiah 30:22; 64:6) [see Naked, Wine (Old)]
|||Gather||Abounding love of God shown to His people after a period of scattering (Zechariah 10:8-12) where He rebuilds His temple (denominated people), re-establishes His covenants (Laws), appoints a prophet to guide and direct them and purposes to fulfill His blessings of imputing His own righteousness upon them (Ezekiel 28:25, 26). The four angels of Revelation 14 and 18 are foreshadowed as carpenters (Zechariah 1:20, 21), come to rebuild God's temple and re-establish the covenant relationship with God. The gathering typifies the Mystery of Godliness, shown in the God of mercy and grace gathering the undeserving who through repentance, embrace His promises by faith to inherit His eternal kingdom. The second and final gathering movement, symbolizing the final works of Jesus Christ empowered by the Holy Spirit which precedes Christ's Second Coming, will gather in all spiritual Children of Israel and foreigners under One Lord. In that day, the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah will be gathered together as one under One Shepherd, Jesus Christ, Who will blot out all of their sins, establish His everlasting kingdom of peace, dwell among them and banish His enemies for good. (Isaiah 11:11-16; Hosea 1:10, 11; 11:7-12; Ezekiel 37:15-28; Joel 3:1, 2; Micah 4:1-4, 5:3, 4). [see Seven Times (gathering), Scatter, Ensign, Number #2520; Remnant; ? Indignation (the Lord's)]
|||Generation||1. A forty year time period according to the Bible (Numbers 32:13; 14:20-39; Psalm 95:10; Hebrews 3:9, 10) Noah preached for 3 generations, 120yrs, before probation was closed for the antediluvians. Under the fourth generation of the time of Noah, the cup of transgression reached its full and God's wrath was poured out. Similarly, in the time of Joel, the 4th generation saw the destruction by Babylon (Joel 1:1-5). The generation of people brought out of Egypt over the age of 20, all died in the wilderness (except Caleb and Joshua) due to their unbelief. The generation that beholds the budding leaves of spring, caused by the Latter Rain will be the last generation on earth (Luke 21:29-33). [see Latter Rain, Times of Refreshing]
2. A reference to the creation week made up of six literal days and nights in Genesis 2:4. Each day is referred to as a generation because "that in it God generated, or produced, some new portion of His work." {PP 112.1}.
|||Generation of vipers||(Matthew 23:29-36) [see Seed of the serpent]
|||Gentiles (Spiritual)||Heathen; a people estranged/aliens from the True God; enemies of God's people (Isaiah 42:1); symbol of Papal System during the 1,260year reign (Luke 21:24; Rev 11:1, 2)
|||Gift of Prophecy||one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, given specifically to the church to edify the church. Given by the Holy Spirit to those He has entrusted to be His spokesperson. The prophetic gift when given, may embody one or all of the following: the spirit of revelation (the reception of a message), discernment (understanding and discerning the Spirit of God verses that of the enemy), and interpretation (providing wisdom and clarity to that which is revealed to those who are to receive it). The prophetic gift brings clarity to past events, current events, and future events (Daniel 2, 7-12; Acts 1:15-17; 2:15-21, 25-32; 3:12-18; 5:1-11; 1 Cor 12:1-11; 14:1, 5, 22-25, 39; the Book of Revelation)
|||Glorious Holy Mountain||Jerusalem or Heaven; Mount Zion (Daniel 11:45; Psalm 48:1, 2; Isaiah 2:2, 3; 52:1; 1 Tim 3:15; Joel 2:1; 3:16, 17; Daniel 9:16); God's church triumphant that is gathered together from spiritual Egypt by the three Angel's messages (Isaiah 27:12, 13; 11:10-16).
|||Glorious Land (The)||Palestine for the Nation of Israel was the Pleasant Land (Exodus 3:8; Numbers 13:27; Ezekiel 20:6, 15, 42; Malachi 3:11, 12); the United States for Spiritual Israel (Deut 3:25; Dan 11:41; Rev 13:11, 12; Jeremiah 3:18, 19; Ezek 20:6, 15; Joel 2:20); a plentiful, delightsome country; given so the church could observe God's laws, have religious freedom, have freedom of conscience, and be a light to the rest of the world (Psalm 105:42-45); a fruitful land flowing with milk and honey. Adventist pioneer Hiram Edson first preached and wrote this truth. [see Milk, Honey, Butter and Honey/Milk & Honey]
|||Gog||chief prince of the land of Magog, the territory belonging to one of seven princes born to Japheth, the son of Noah. The forces of Gog that include the Persians, the Ethiopians and Libyans, all confederate and join league against the remnant of God that have been gathered after a period of being scattered. They are depicted as riding upon horses and coming as a whirlwind to fall upon the unwalled villages where God's people are at rest and dwell safely. The Lord in His fury takes up vengeance against Gog and the forces so that He causes an earthquake to shake the entire earth, He stirs confusion among the forces so they turn on one another and he rains down an overflowing rain, hail, fire and brimstone. That which remains will be a feast to the birds and fowl of the earth that will eat the flesh and drink the blood of mighty men of the earth. This utter devastation is known as the Sacrifice of the Lord and the Supper of the Great God. This spiritual battle is none other than the conclusion of the seven last plagues and God's overthrowing the powers of earth at Christ's Second Coming (Ezekiel 38, 39; Revelation 20:8, 9). [see Ethiopia; Libya; Supper of the Great God]
|||Gold (tried in fire)||perfect faith (righteousness) working through love (Rev 3:18; Malachi 3:3) [see White Robes (Raiment); Eyesalve]
|||Golden City||Babylon [literal and spiritual] (Isaiah 14:4-11).

Each of these cities in type, symbolize an aspect of Modern Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots:
  a) Nineveh, the "great city of Assyria" (Jonah 1:2; Nahum 1-3) [see Nineveh]
  b) Babylon, that great city [literal and spiritual] (Isaiah 14:4-11; Rev 17:18; 16:19; 18:10). [see Rabbah]
  c) Tyrus
  d) Zidon, the "great city" [see Zidon]
  e) Israel, the "sinful kingdom" (Amos 9:1-8; Habakkuk 2:9-12)
  f) France, spiritually called Sodom and Egypt (Revelation 11:8)
  g) Modern Rome (Revelation 17:18, 16:19)
|||Great Controversy (The)||
  1. The spiritual conflict originating in heaven between God and the once exalted angel, Lucifer, turned Satan (accuser) and Devil. The conflict commenced through the mystery of iniquity (2 Thessalonians 2:7) founded in the heart of Lucifer, who coveted the praise, adoration and honor belonging to God alone. Thinking the kingdom of God could be established on selfish motives, Lucifer sought to usurp God's throne and authority by deception, craft, and force. The controversy was extended to this earth when Adam forsook his exalted position as son of God and head of the earth to ally with the rebellious angel. Today the great controversy is manifested throughout our world in the sons of men who swear, lie, kill, steal, commit adultery - lacking truth, mercy, and a knowledge of God (Hosea 4:1-19; Micah 6:1, 2, 9-16). The resolution to the great controversy has been established through the incarnation, sinless life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, Who thereby:
    1.1. Vindicated God's character of Love and Truth to the universe
    1.2. Established God's Laws and Government as eternal and immutable
    1.3. Authored a means to save humanity and reconcile men to God and one another
    1.4. Broke the bondage of sin that held men captive
    1.5. Conquered the power of the grave
    1.6. Revealed the true character of Satan and his kingdom
    1.7. Assured the eventual and final destruction of sin, death, and the devil

The final works of God in completing the Plan of Redemption, the answer to the Great Controversy, are
being fulfilled in these last days (Isaiah 14:12-17; Ezekiel 28:12-18; Revelation 12:7-13; Jude 1:6). [see
Craft (Consummate)]

  2. Title of the book of prophetic counsel penned by the messenger of the Lord for the Last Days, Ellen G. White. Sister White received inspiration for the book in 1858 when she and her husband conducted the funeral of a young man and when Sister White stood to give her comments, she was carried off into vision that lasted two hours. The subject of the vision was the Great Controversy between Christ and Satan, from heaven until the end of time. A few days later after having the vision, she suffered a paralyzing stroke but was spared by a miracle of Providence. The stroke was debilitating such that she would only be able to write one day and take two to three days off at a time. In September 1858, the book was published. After fully recovering from the stroke, she was shown that the illness was brought upon her by the devil to thwart her efforts in writing the Great Controversy.
|||Greek, Latin and Hebrew||Symbolically, the languages of the three-fold union of powers (The Jews, the Popular Society (Greek), and Rome) that warred against Jesus Christ (John 19:20; Luke 23:38; Acts 4:27) - a foreshadowing of the three-fold power (False Prophet, Dragon, Beast) that will war against God and His saints in the final battle of Armageddon (Revelation 16:13-16) [see Confederate/Confederacy, False Prophet, Dragon, Beast]
|||Hades||the grave (Rev 20:13) (see Pleasant Land)
|||Hail||a symbol for an invading army (Isaiah 28:1-3, 30:30, 31)
|||Hail and Fire Mingled with Blood||"Hail" Signifying the northern origin of Aleric, the invading Goth upon the Western Empire; "fire" signifying the destruction by flame of city and country that followed Gothic path; "blood" signifying the destruction of the inhabitants. (Revelation 8:7)
|||Hand||A symbol of one's works; the fruit of their hand and labor from which they will reap a harvest. Jesus judges us according to our works, the things that we do in the body. (Revelation 13:16; 22:12). [see Hand (right); Forehead]
|||Hand (of Israel)||Hand of the Lord; to be counted among the faithful of God; to "escape" the Hand of the King of the North by upholding the Law of God and the faith of Jesus Christ [Righteousness by Faith] (Deut 33:1-3; Isaiah 41:10; Rev 14:12) [see Escape]
|||Hand (of the King of the North)||Hand of the Papacy that waged war against the saints and prevailed for a period of 1,260 years (Daniel 7:25, Revelation 11:2, 12:14, 13:5-6). It is through the enforcement of a Sunday Law, a repetition of the past scourge against the people of God, that the Papacy will once again stretch forth its hand to gather at the end of the world. Those who will be given into his hand at the end of time are they who will be overtaken by the wine of her (Papacy) fornication, receiving the Mark of the Beast (Daniel 11:41). The chief princes of Edom, Ammon, and Moab are said to escape the Hand of the King of the North as they obey the remnant of Israel (an ensign), who are being gathered in from the four corners of the earth at the time when God is stretching forth His hand a second time (Isaiah 11:10-14) [see Image to the Beast; Mark of the Beast (the); Ensign; Edom, Ammon and Moab; Overthrown]
|||Hand (right)||the limb from which the law of God was written; the limb of the man that is restored by Jesus to symbolize the medical missionary work, which is the right hand of the gospel (and the 3rd Angel's Message) that is necessary to the cause of God. The medical mission field is to be an opening wedge to present the gospel; the experience of righteousness by faith as spoken by the 3 rd Angel's message; symbolic of fellowship one with another and with the Father and Christ after having an experience (seeing, handling, hearing) the Word of life. The message of the true Sanctuary, the message of the Little Book, the Sabbath, the Covenant and all the above speak of the right hand of God's righteousness. The Mark of the Beast will be applied to either the right hand or forehead of those who reject God's truth and righteousness for evil. (Luke 6:6-11; Deuteronomy 33:1, 2; Isaiah 58:12-14, 41:10; Galatians 2:9; 1 John 1:1-3; Revelation 1:9-19; 2 Corinthians 6:14-18; Psalm 98:1, 2, 118:15, 16; Lamentations 2:3 Revelation 15:2-4; 14:1-3; 13:16)
|||Harlot||see Whore/Harlot
|||Harvest [noun]||One's character yielding fruit of righteousness or fruit of wickedness.
|||Harvest/Reap (to) [verb]||The end of the world; separating the just (wheat) from the unjust (tare) and gathering each to give each their respective rewards (Matt 13:18-30, 36-43; Galatians 6:7; Rev 14:14-20; Rev 22:12) [see Summer]
He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second = Divine principal of substitution that is noted in the workings of God throughout the Bible. A reference to the symbols/types and related antitypes shown throughout the Bible to provide object lessons to the people of God regarding His works of redemption. The principal is shown in the following:
  - God's removing the earthly sanctuary with its rites, rituals and services for the more excellent, celestial sanctuary built by God
  - God's removing of the earthly High Priestly ministry for His own celestial High Priestly ministry
  - God's removing of the Old Covenant for a New Covenant, based on better promises (Jeremiah 31:31-34; Hebrews 8:6)
  - God's removal of the Levitical priesthood that is based on the rites contained in the Law of Moses for a new priesthood (sons of Levi), based on the righteousness of Christ (1 Peter 2:9, 10; Malachi 3:3, 4; Romans 3:20-22)
  - God's removal of the Hebrew Nation as a special treasure and peculiar people for the Christian Church

In seeking to parrot the workings of Christ, Satan too copies this principle as he removes the Daily inorder to establish the Abomination of Desolation.
|||Heads (on beasts)||Nation or power
|||Head and Tail, Branch and Rush||Hebrew parallelism used to describe the great men of old and of great honor and authority among Gods people, the kings, priests and pastors [the head/branch] and the prophets [the tail/rush], who rather than feeding the people with knowledge and understanding, fail to rebuke unrighteousness, promote apostasy, prophecy lies, and lead God's people astray to be destroyed, all of whom God will consume. The incessant, deceptive lies of the false prophets caused the people of God to coin the proverb "The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth... The vision that he seeth [is] for many days [to come], and he prophesieth of the times [that are] far off.", lulling the people into complacency and apostasy; yet the Lord through His true prophet who bore words of chastisement and rebuke counters the common proverb by saying "The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision... 
There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD." It is the leadership that through selfish ambition and gain have perverted justice and laid a bad example for the masses. The Leadership in Christ's day were they who conspired against Him and caused (persuaded) the crowds to call for Jesus' crucifixion. (Isaiah 9:14-16; Jeremiah 2:7, 8, 26, 3:15, 4:22, 5:5, 12, 13, 26-28, 31; 7:1-32; 8:1-11; 12:10, 11; 50:6, 7; Ezekiel 12:22-28, 13:1-16, 22:23-28; Hosea 6:9, 10; Amos 3:1-3, 9-11; Matthew 26:59). [see Watchmen (Blind); Drunkards of Ephraim; Briers and Thorns; Blaspheme/Blasphemy]
|||Heart (The)||The source of man's desires; the reflection of character and motive within that is demonstrated in one's actions, priorities, and treasures. The Bible says that man's heart is by nature deceptive, self-willed, and unknown to man; however, God who searches the hearts, comprehends all things (Psalm 139:23, 24; Jeremiah 42, 43). [Men are not murderers because they murder, men murder because they are murderers (by nature); men are not liars because they lie, men lie because they are liars (by nature); thus, the natural human condition]. God desires to perform a transplant of our natural, stony heart with a heart of flesh that has His law inscribed on it so that it is inclined to obey and seek His will and desires. Those who are cleansed and made pure receive this heart transplant from the Lord and will be made to be God's people before the earth (Matthew 6:19-21, 24, 15:17-20; 1 Timothy 6:6-10; Jeremiah 7:9-11, 13:23, 17:5-10, 31:31-34; Ezekiel 11:19-21, 36:22-38; Isaiah 64:6; John 2:23-25, 7:24; 2 Corinthians 3:2, 3). [see Purge/Purify; Eyes (The); Forehead]
|||Heart of the Earth||A term used by Jesus when describing the series of events including His apprehension, trials, scourging, death on the cross, and rest in burial, all spanning three days and three nights; commencing with the Hour of the Power of Darkness (Thursday Night), when Christ was given into the hands of evil men to be tried and concluding with His glorious resurrection from the dead on Sunday morning. The Heart of the Earth signifies the thoughts, motives, works and wisdom that "descendeth not from above, but [is] earthly, sensual, devilish" and is borne by the devil, evil men, and all the powers of evil who until the Hour of the Power of Darkness were forbidden to touch or harm Jesus because His time to be glorified had not arrived. When the time had arrived, the angels that were given charge over Jesus were withdrawn and the King of Glory was made to face the devil and all the powers of evil by Himself, with the Father watching close by (Matthew 12:40; James 3:15; Psalm 91:11, 12; John 12:23, 27, 16:32, 17:1; Luke 22:47-5; Matthew 28:1-6). [see Heart (The)]
|||Heaven (first)||The specifically designed atmosphere of planet hearth, also called the Firmament, that contains water to rain/snow upon the earth and protect the earth from the harmful elements of outer space (Genesis 1:6-8). [see Host of Heaven1]
|||Heaven (second)||Outer space where the sun, moon, and stars are part of our galaxy. [see Host of Heaven]
|||Heaven (third)||The celestial home of God and the angels (2 Corinthians 12:2). [see Host of Heaven 3]
|||Hebrew||term means one from a land beyond, or one who has crossed over [from a land beyond to another]
|||Herbs||the planting of the Lord which is good for food (seasonings), unlike briars and thorns (Genesis 9:3; Psalm 104:14; Hebrews 6:7)
|||Herbs (Bitter)||That which was eaten with the Passover Lamb and unleavened bread, symbolizing the bitterness of experience required by Jesus to win mankind's salvation (Exodus 12:8; Numbers 9:11). [see Sigh & Cry, Bitter/Sweet (Taste)]
|||Hermeneutics||[Root word Hermes - the Greek god of interpretation/translation said to be the intermediary between the gods and mankind] is the method of Bible exposition, interpretation and translation based on [man's] knowledge. Hermeneutics as a discipline, often synonymous with exegesis, analyzes written, verbal and non-verbal communications whereas, exegesis focuses primarily upon texts. Founded by Friedrich Schleiermacher [theologian, philosopher] during the 18th Century, he attempted to reconcile the criticism of the Enlightenment with the traditional Protestant Church theologies. He was also influential in founding modern Higher Criticism [Historical Critical Method] which "short circuits the belief that certain books are word for word truth, suggesting that the truth therefore, lies in the historical context." The method attempts to analyze the "world behind the text" - the era, social, political, language, cultural, specific events, things and customs as context to reconstruct the "original meaning/understanding" of the text. The method implies an understanding of the original language to interpret and understand the meaning of texts. This implies therefore, that the educated class is most apt to understand and apply the writings. Bible verses that challenge this method of study are as follows: God has prescribed the method of Proof Texting: Isaiah 28:9-13, Hebrews 11:6 God has made the "foolish"/poor/weak to be rich in faith, confounding the wise: James 2:5, 1 Corinthians 1:18-25, Colossians 2:6-9, Romans 1:16, 17, Psalm 19:7, 119:130 God has removed language as a barrier to communicating and understanding the gospel: Acts 2 Christ and the Holy Spirit are man's Intercessors to the Father, imparting knowledge: 1Timothy 2:5, John 16:13 This method exalts man and his knowledge (Acts of the Apostles 474.1; 1 Corinthians 8:1). [see ? Proof Texting]
|||Hiddekel/Tigris||River where Daniel receives a glorious vision of Christ, though those who accompanied him did not see the vision but ran in fear; foreshadowing the two classes of people at Christ's Second Coming (Daniel 10:4-12; 12:5). Jesus stands above the river and reveals to Daniel the most comprehensive panoramic view of world events (Daniel 10-12). Symbolically the river Hiddekel, flows into the Sea of Glass before the Lord [see Ulai, King of the North].
|||Hiding of His Power||A term used in the book of Habbakuk 3:4 to denote the glory revealed from Christ's nail pierced hands. The light (horns) flashing from Christ's hands reveal the great humiliation suffered by Christ that in turn reflect His greatest glory, the sign of God's great love for mankind and the glory shown through humility (Philippians 2:5-11).
|||High Places, Groves, Alters||All of the places where self-exalting, sensual, false worship to sun moon and stars have been committed. The place where God's people have committed whoredom with the world, and turned from their first love, following God. God raised up reformers such as Hezekiah and Josiah who struck down the groves, alters and high places so that the Children of Israel would worship once again the true God. The high places, groves and alters are symbolic of the sins that sit in high places within the heart. Only after God has torn down these high places, purging and purifying the heart, can true worship be restored and revival made (2 Kings 23; Isaiah 27:9; Jeremiah 3:2, 3; 6-14, 21-23; 13:26, 27; Ezekiel 20:27-31; Hosea 4:12, 13; Micah 5:10-15). [see Sun, Moon, & Stars; "Eaten Upon the Mountains"; Children of the Night/Darkness; Purge/Purify]
|||Hireling||A hired hand that does not have love for the Lord's sheep, flees when danger arises and are merely hired to do a work (John 10:12, 13); 2those under the Lord's employment that He uses for a time to do His biddings. That God would at times use those who were enemies of the people whom He had chosen, shows His ruler ship over all beings, good and bad as well as His ultimate control through the complex courses of world events (Judges 9:23, 1 Kings 22:19-23; Hosea 13:15). The following nations were used as God's hirelings for a time to bring punishment upon other nations:
  1. A "Lying Spirit" - A demon the Lord used to confound the rebellious King Ahab through false prophets (1 Kings 22:1-28)
  2. Razor for Hire (the) - Bee of Assyria - Assyrians against Ethiopia, Egypt, Israel & Judah (2 Kings 17:3-7; 18:9-16; Isaiah 20:1-6; Jeremiah 50:17; Hosea 10:1-7)
  3. Fly of Egypt - the Egyptians against Israel & Judah (Isaiah 7:17, 18; Amos 3:9-15)
  4. The Rod of Mine Anger; Staff in their Hand is Mine indignation - Assyrians against Samaria (Isaiah 10:5)
  5. Lion and Young Lion - Assyrians and Babylon who tread down, tear in pieces, scatter, devour and brake Israel and Judah respectively (Micah 5:8; Hosea 5:13, 14, 13:7, 8; Jeremiah 50:17)
  6. The army of the Lord (locusts) - symbolizing Babylon that would overthrow the land of Judah(Joel 1:1-12, 2:1-11, 20)
  7. The Spoilers - the Babylonians upon Israel (Jeremiah 12:12, 13; 25:9-12, 27:1-22, 50:17)
  8. The "Destroying Mountain", "the servant", "mighty one of the heathen", "terrible of the nations" and "hammer of the whole earth" - the Babylonians against Egypt (God's payment for their "service" in destroying Tyrus), the Philistines, Moab, the Ammonites, the Edomites and Tyre (Jeremiah 46, 47, 48, 49, 50:22-24; 51:24-26; Ezekiel 29:17-20, 30:1-26)
  9. God's Battle Axe and Weapon of War - The Medes [and Persians] against Babylon (Isaiah 13, 14; Jeremiah 51; Daniel 5:28; Zechariah 1:14, 15)
  10. A "Ravenous Bird" - The Persians against Babylon (Isaiah 46:11) [see Elam]
  11. The "King's Army" - Pagan Rome against apostate Israel in 70AD, as portrayed in the parable of Matthew 22:1-10
  12. "Four Carpenters" - those appointed by God to fray the four Gentile nations that scattered Judah (Zechariah 1:18-21)
  13. The Hireling - The Lord's Army - Moab - Islam against the whore Babylon (Isaiah 16:14; Joel 2:2-11; Revelation 9:1-6, 17-21) [see East Wind; Locust; Woes (three)]
|||Honey||The prophetic judgments and words of the Lord that give warning and counsel (Psalm 19:9-11; 119:97-103); The wisdom of God (Proverbs 24:13, 14; Song of Solomon 4:11). Prophecies of Daniel & Revelation (Rev 10:10; Ezekiel 3:3). [see Butter and Honey/Milk & Honey]
|||Honey for Sweetness||The sweet message and the joyful reception of the message of redemption (Deuteronomy 32:13) and the prophetic word of counsel to the wise. The truths of God's word and His counsels to protect from impending judgment are sweet upon the lips of those who are likened to the wise (Psalm 19:8-11). In turn, the same one will teach others as a faithful watchman, the same wise counsels and his words will be as sweetness upon the lips (Proverbs 1:2-7; 11:30; 16:21, 23, 24; Jeremiah 15:16; Ezekiel 3:1-3; Revelation 10:1, 8, 9). [see Wise (the), Watchmen] 
|||Horn||Power/might/strength/glory; ecclesiastical and civil powers (kings/rulers/kingdoms) (Dan 8:5, 21; Rev 17:12; 1 Samuel 2:1; 2 Samuel 22:1-3; Amos 6:13; Micah 4:13; Habakkuk 3:4)
|||Horse (Goodly)||God's church triumphant that is produced after the outpouring of the Latter Rains and is characterized by a pure church; one whose sins are blotted out and dispossessed outside the camp. Once the Sunday Law is passed and the wheat and tares of Adventism are identified, God will draw out His people from the world to become part of this victorious, triumphant group (Zechariah 10:1-3; Rev 6:1, 2; Rev 19:11-15). [see Modern Israel]
|||Horse (Wild Arabian Ass)||Prophetic symbol used in Genesis 16:12 when speaking of Ishmael as a "wild man" and projecting in time to his descendents [Amelekites, Midianites, Children of the East], members of Islam, who would be difficult to contain and all the world's hands would be against him. In questioning Job, the Lord asks him "who can lose or restrain this beast besides God Almighty?" Therefore, the Lord is showing that it is at His hands alone that this untamable force for mankind can be loosed or restrained. Radical Islam, the East Wind, will stir apostate Protestantism in the formation of an Image to the Beast. It is the Wild Ass of Arabia [Islam] that causes the towers to become forsaken and become as dens [holes], while the streams and rivers brought by the Latter Rain are falling on the people of God. (Job 39:5-8; Jeremiah 2:24, Rev 7:1-3; Rev 9:1-11; Isaiah 32:14, 30:25, 26) [see Children of the East, Kedar (sons of); Wild (Man), East Wind; Hireling; Locust; Islam] 
|||Horses and Chariots||Military might or power (Jeremiah 46:9)
|||Host (A)||An army; a company of people (Daniel 8:12; Numbers 10:18) [see Arms]
|||Host (the)||The army of the Lord; a body of people; the "temple of Christ" or His people who enter into covenant with Him (Daniel 8:13, Malachi 3:1; 1 Corinthians 6:19; 1 Peter 2:2-8). [see Remnant]
|||Host of heaven||1. The saints of God or the leaders over the saints of God (Daniel 8:10; Revelation 1:20); those who sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 2:6); those who store up treasures in heaven and not earth (Matthew 6:19, 20, 33); those who walk in the Spirit and not in the flesh (Romans 8:1-10); those in whom the Kingdom of God dwell (Mark 4:11; Luke 8:10, 17:20, 21). [see Saints1]
2. Moon, and the stars; those who worship false Gods (Baal) in the Bible are spoken of worshipping the hosts of heaven or the sun, moon and stars who are made to be deities by pagans (Deuteronomy 4:19, 17:3; 2 Kings 17:16, 23:4, 5; Job 31:26-28; Zephaniah 1:4, 5; Isaiah 15:1-3). [see Sun, Moon, & Stars]
3. The angelic host in heaven. The inhabitants that today stand around the throne of God (1 Kings 22:19; 2 Chronicles 18:18). [see Angel; Saints2]
|||Hot or Cold||Jesus desires that Christians be therapeutic in their life work and ministry to a sin sick world. Our influence should be for good, giving soothing and healing by either the hot or cold application of faith, grace, mercy, kindness, gentleness, and Christian love. A lukewarm faith adds no value to the spiritual malaise of the world as its tepid influence blends in with its environment rather than being a transforming agent to its environment - making it also hot or cold (Revelation 3:14-19). [see ? Lukewarm, Spiritualism:Transformism]
|||Hour of Temptation||Time of testing, trial, and hour of darkness for the church of God when they are given into the hands of sinners by the apostate church (son of perdition). The disciples slept during their hour of temptation when Christ wrestled in Gethsemane and the three-fold power assembled against Jesus (Matthew 26:36-47; Luke 22:52, 53). When Jesus was apprehended, the disciples scattered and forsook Jesus. Time of testing for the remnant church when the kings of the earth and the two horned Beast power will enforce the Mark of the Beast where all must worship the Beast power on threat of imprisonment, persecution, or death (Revelation 3:10; 17:12-14; Revelation 13:8, 3; 6:) [see Shaking (the), Mark of the Beast]
|||Hour of the Power of Darkness||See Heart of the Earth
|||House Filled with Smoke||The presence of the Lord; priest cannot enter in, nor minister in the temple signifying the completion of a sacred work and God's glorification; close of probation (Exodus 16:10; 24:16; 40:34, 35; Isaiah 6:3; 2 Chronicles 7:1, 2; 1 Kings 8:9-11; Rev 15:5-8) [see Closed Door]
|||Image||A likeness or reflection in character, purpose, or intent. (Daniel 3:1-7; Revelation 13:14)
|||Image to the Beast||When the Protestant leaders [religious] working in concert with political [secular] leaders of the U.S. establish civil enforcement of religious doctrine, an image to the Beast [Popery] is formed (Psalm 94:20-23). "The beast was the Papacy clothed with power, to put to death the saints of God. Rev. xiii, 5-8; Dan. Vii, 23-26. An image to the beast then, must be another ecclesiastical body, clothed with power and authority to put the saints to death. This can refer to nothing else but the corrupt and fallen Protestant church" [The Three Angels of Revelation 14:6-12, pg 108, J.N. Andrews]. Brought about by an unrighteous decree first seen prophetically in the worship of the golden calf at Sinai (Exodus 32:15-19); also called an "overflowing scourge" by the Spirit of Prophecy [Country Living pg. 12.4]. Protestant America, acting the role of the False Prophet, will be the vanguard in instituting a law for Sunday observance, casting down the Law of God (Isaiah 5:24; Psalm 119:126; Habakkuk 1:5, 6), which will in turn influence the world [the Dragon4] to follow suit (Rev 13:14, 15; Hosea 4:6). Apostate Protestantism (whorish women) that had rejected truth in the brightness of the First and Second Angel's Messages, will embrace the darkness of Papal authority, taking hold of its hands though eating of their own bread [doctrine] and wearing their own garments [keeping their own traditions and teachings of self-righteousness] (Isaiah 4:1) for fear of the reproach of men over the Law of God, particularly the 4th Commandment Sabbath (Isaiah 51:7; Luke 6:22, 23, Matt 24:9; Rev 14:1; 3:12). The establishment of the Image to the Beast will be accomplished through craft and subtlety over time and may be possibly birthed in the following manner:
  1. Establishment of a Sunday Rest Day: A work-free day to promote family unity, rest, pursuit of social good will and cultural endeavors; all the things that the original seventh-day Sabbath were intended to provide by example and commandment of God will be ascribed to Sunday. Establishment of the Sunday Rest Day may be accomplished in the following two waves:
    a. Sunday Closing Laws: The requirement that shops and stores be closed for business on Sundays
    b. Universal Closing Laws: All encompassing closing of all non-essential businesses and services
  2. Establishment of Sunday Religious Observance: Sunday will be recognized as the established day for religious pursuits, above any other days currently used for religious observance. This would constitute the establishment of the Image to the Beast where civil and moral authorities would challenge conscience.
  3. Establishment of the Sunday Law/Anti-Sabbath Law: A civil law that requires the observance and recognition of Sunday as the official day of worship. Punishment for failing to observe this day will result in imprisonment, persecution, and possible death. All who refuse to observe the day will not be permitted to buy nor sell. The establishment of the Sunday Law marks the resurrection of the former transgression of desolation that was a hallmark of the Church of Rome during the Dark Ages.

Prophetically, the Image to the Beast may additionally come about as an act of homage to the church known as the Mother of Harlots after it has extended its hands through craft to "remedy" the world governments' social and moral woes it had very much to do in creating (1 Kings 21:1-16). The time of the Sunday Law marks the Close of Probation for Adventism where the Foolish Virgins of Adventism are overthrown, they will stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared and be taken (Isaiah 8:14, 15). Having their crowns taken away, they stand without Christ as their Mediator/Intercessor, not hearing their prayers; they are counted as God's enemies, and receive the Mark of the Beast so that they will receive God's wrath (Ezekiel 8). Because they have not feared God nor given Him glory but have turned to the confederated powers of darkness through Spiritualism, giving head to seducing spirits that mutter and peep, rather than the sure Word of God (Revelation 14:6, 7; Isaiah 8:12, 13, 17, 19, 20). However, in that day of the passing of the Sunday Law, the servants of God will shine as bright as the firmament and will lead many sons to righteousness. In this day, the testimony of God will be bound up and the Law of God sealed among God's disciples (Isaiah 4:1-4, 23:15-17; 8:16) [see Beast (lamb-like); Beast (leopard-like); Pharaoh; False Prophet; Dragon4; Craft; Transgression of Desolation; Overthrown; Shut Door Message; Bread (corn/grain); Spiritualism 3SM 385.2] In Measure (By Measure) - A portion, not complete (Ezekiel 4:11). The giving of the Holy Spirit at different points in church history was given in measure (Jeremiah 30:11, 46:28). Jesus was given the Holy Spirit without measure, the Adventist church will be given the Latter Rain in measure (1888 & today). Prophetically, the Bible states that when the Latter Rain message arrives, those in Adventism will "debate with it" (Isaiah 27:8). When the message is given to the rest of the world by the Holy Spirit, it is given without measure (John 3:34, Isaiah 27:2-8). [see Latter Rain] 
|||Incense||the prayers of the saints [the faithful of God] (Psalm 141:2; Rev 5:8) 
|||Indignation (the Lord's)||God's anger and punishment towards Israel for breaking the covenant causing them to be scattered among their enemies (Lamentations 2:1-6; Ezekiel 22:15-31; Deuteronomy 29:27-29; Zechariah 1:12; Isaiah 10:5-11; Hosea 8:7-14). The conclusion of the "first indignation" ended in 1798 for Israel (the Northern Kingdom) and the "last indignation" ended in 1844 for Judah (the Southern Kingdom). The last (final) indignation completes the gathering where the once separated Northern and Southern Kingdoms of Israel are brought together as one flock under one Shepherd who cleanses them and pardons their sins [Day of Atonement] (Jeremiah 50:17-20; Ezekiel 37:15-23). (Daniel 8:19; Nehemiah 1:5-11). [see Number #2,5201 [scattering], Number #2,5202 [gathering], Scatter, Day of Atonement (antitypical)]
|||Investigative Judgment||A period of probation when God evaluates the works of men whether good or bad that He may reward them accordingly. The investigation is conducted objectively in truth and righteousness where the searcher of men's hearts and thoughts weighs men's works against the eternal standard, the Law of God. Foreshadowed throughout the Bible (Genesis 3:9-13; 4:9, 10; 6:5, 12, 13; 11:5, 6; Jeremiah 5:1-4; Ezekiel 20:37, 38) the pre-Second Advent judgment occurs in the heavenly courts, officiated by Jesus, overseen by the Father, and attended by the angels as eyewitnesses/jury. The judgment determines the fate of everyone, whether their sins are blotted out and their names remain in the Lambs Book of Life or whether their sins remain and their names are blotted out of the Lambs Book of Life. Coincident with the judgment is the Times of Refreshing when the Holy Spirit is poured out without measure to turn the hearts of men towards God as well as the Shaking, times of testing and trial to seal the fate of everyone. (Deuteronomy 13:14, 19:18; Isaiah 43:25, 26; Daniel 7:9-14; Zechariah 3:1-5; Acts 3:19-21; Revelation 3:5, 20:12; Isaiah 27:7; Matthew 22:11, 12; Jeremiah 50:17-20) [see Book of Life (the Lamb's) [Book of the Living]; Day of Atonement (antitypical); Measure the temple of God; "Pass under the Rod"; Number #2300; Winds (Holding the Four), Times of Refreshing, Shaking (the)]
|||Iron||1. Civil authority or statecraft (Deut 28:47-50; Daniel 2:41-43; Revelation 2:26, 27; 12:5; 19:15)
2. Material that is used to represent government or civil authority; 2The metal that is used to denote the Roman Empire in the visions of Daniel 2 and 7. (Revelation 2:26, 27, 12:5; used to denote strength, hardness, ruthlessness, harsh punishment (Leviticus 26:19, Numbers 35:16; Deuteronomy 28:48; Joshua 17:16; Psalm 2:8, 9) [see Iron Mixed with Miry Clay]
|||Iron and Brass||Materials signifying punishment for rebellion brought upon those who are unfaithful to God. Yet in mercy for the Redeemed once gathered in to the Lord, He promises to turn our brass into gold and our iron into silver. (Leviticus 26:19; Deuteronomy 28:15-23; Psalm 107:11-16; Daniel 4:12-16; Isaiah 48:1, 4; 60:17). [see Scattering]
|||Iron Furnace||A reference to the nation of Egypt, that was oppressive unto the Children of Israel (Deuteronomy 4:20; 1 Kings 8:51; Jeremiah 11:4) 
|||Iron Mixed with Miry Clay||The unholy, satanic union of the state and church that is formed to oppress and condemn the people of God as foreshadowed in the book of Daniel (Daniel 2:43). This union was first seen within the Nation of Israel where the corrupt church leadership [priests and prophets] in league with wayward princes and kings persecuted the prophets of God (Jeremiah 26:20-24). Jesus Himself was first tried by the Jewish Sanhedrin and then brought before Roman officials to be condemned (Luke 22:47-23:25). Jesus forewarned that His servants would experience the same scourge, as seen during the Dark Ages and soon to be realized in these Last Days (Luke 12:11, 12; 21:12-15; Revelation 13:11-18). [see Transgression of Desolation]
|||Islam||Descendents of Abraham and Ishmael (born of Kedar) who settled east of Palestine who are called the "hirelings" of God, to reap vengeance upon the apostate world power of the papacy. Another construct of satanic origin, Islam was formed to appeal to those who through prejudice, would not in times past dare to test/prove the Jewish faith, nor its successor, the Christian faith. Those who from their parental lineage [the son of the flesh - Ishmael] provoked those who descended from the son of promise [Isaac], have ever contested the rights of inheritance from their mutual ancestor Abraham (Galatians 4:22-31). Satan, who incited this initial rivalry (Genesis 16, 21:1-13), took occasion to raise up a people and world religion whose doctrines were opposed to the teachings of a son of promise who would bring forth the Seed, Jesus Christ, to be Heir of Salvation for the world (Romans 9:4-9). Islam in its inception around 610AD, beholding the lavish lifestyle of Bishops and Popes, the vain formalism, and the worldliness of the corrupt Church of Rome in contrast to the lowly Jesus, sited the Church of Rome as justification for opposing the Christian faith. However, in its foundational tenets and principles, Islam, like all other man made religions, bore the same markings of paganism as those of corrupt Papal Rome[man's attempt to save himself through his own works and merit]. Therefore, Islam from its inception was raised up to oppose Judeo-Christianity, particularly "those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads" [Papists] (Revelation 9:2-5). Islam was raised up to be a scourge against the apostate Church of Rome, yet the Lord used it as a shield of defense for the true people of God who had the seal of God in their forehead, worshipping God in Spirit and in truth on the Sabbath day. This fact is confirmed historically through the words of Abu Bakr, father-in-law to Mohammed and ruler over the Arabian tribes in 632AD after Mohammed's death who commanded to his armies: "When you fight the battles of the Lord, acquit yourselves like men, without turning your backs; but let not your victory be stained with the blood of women or children. Destroy no palm-trees, nor burn any fields of corn. Cut down no fruit-trees, nor do any mischief to cattle, only such as you kill to eat... As you go on, you will find some religious persons who live retired in monasteries, and propose to themselves to serve God that way; let them alone, and neither kill them nor destroy their monasteries: and you will find another sort of people that belong to the synagogue of Satan, who have shaven crowns; be sure to cleave their skulls, and give them no quarter till they either turn Mahometans or pay 'tribute.'" [Edward Gibbons, The Decline and Fall of the Roma Empire, Vol V. Chap 51, pg 189, 190] The battles mentioned by Abu Bakr were against the Crusaders, armies raised up by the Church of Rome to root out the Protestant Movement, but also to stay the spread of Islam (Children of the East). Practically speaking, Islam has sought to distance itself from true Christianity and the corrupt Church of Rome in its selection of its day of worship. As true Christians honor the seventh-day Sabbath, the emblem of God's Creation and His completed works of Redemption memorialized in the Fourth Commandment, the apostate Church of Rome has exalted the counterfeit day of worship, Sunday, and Islam similiarly, in opposition to both faiths, chose Friday to be its sacred day of worship. Prophetically, Papal Rome established the visions of the power to the North (King of the North) that waged war and ravaged the people of God, however, Islam empowered the visions in its confirmation of the identity of the Roman power. When Rome is shown to rise to power prophetically, Islam can be shown at its heals to oppose it. Islam is shown to rise against the apostate church power under the 5th, 6th and 7th trumpets of Revelation 9 and 11, as "Woes" to befall the Church of Rome and the world. Islam, sons of Ishmael (Genesis 25:12-16; 21:12-20), are they whose hands will be against the world and the world's hands against it. In the confluence of world powers marshaled against God and His people, Islam falls under the banner of the Dragon power or Spiritualism/Paganism. Islam will play a significant role of catalyst (East Winds) to incite final events that will marshal the Dragon, Beast, and False Prophet to unify the world in creating an Image to the Beast (Isaiah 21). "Angels are holding the four winds, which are represented as an angry horse seeking to break loose and rush over the face of the whole earth, bearing destruction and death in its path" [Selected Messages Bk 3 pg 409]. Islam fulfills this prophetic truth describing present times, where Islam and the global powers of earth are marshaled against one another while the people of God are receiving the Seal of God in their foreheads. In this sense, Islam is an aid (distraction, stalling for the people of God) in staying the global conflagration towards the people of God that is to take place in the Four Winds, while simultaneously acting as its catalyst.

|||Israel||A heavenly name meaning "Prince with God" and "One who overcomes with God", given to Jacob, representing the change in name and change in character given to the righteous who themselves are victorious by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony (Revelation 2:17, 3:12). The name has its complete realization through Jesus Christ, the Prince who Himself overcomes with God and stands watch over His people until He inherits His kingdom (Revelation 1:5; Acts 5:31; Daniel 10:21; Luke 19:12-27). [see Jacob]
|||Jacob||Grandson of Abraham known as the "Supplanter" for his deceptive characteristics. By the grace and mercies of God, Jacob is converted and given the name "Israel", the "Overcomer" through God's strength. A foreshadowing of the Laodecian Church at the end of time who through receiving the Latter Rain message are converted and made a mighty army for the Lord that blossoms and buds, becoming as the church of Philadelphia (Isaiah 27:2-6). [see Latter Rain]
|||Jeroboam, son of Nebat||First king of the divided Kingdom of Israel (Northern Kingdom, Samaria) who did evil in the sight of the Lord. Departing from the promises of God given him to establish his household over 10 tribes of Israel, Jeroboam furthers the worship of idols by giving Israel two golden calves as their god, one of which was placed in Bethel (the House of God), forbidding the people from returning to Jerusalem to celebrated the covenant holy days, and proclaiming an unrighteous decree (Isaiah 10:1) in creating a counterfeit sabbath holy day on the 15th day of the 8 th month, a Sunday. Jeroboam foreshadows the man of sin and son of perdition in establishing this counterfeit sabbath festival, which like the golden image erected by Nebuchadnezzar and the counterfeit Sabbath day of worship, all will be forced to pay homage on threat of death. (1 Kings 12:32, 33; 2 Thessalonians 2:3-12; Revelation 13:14-17). Additionally, Jeroboam foreshadows in the last days apostate Protestantism who in rejecting the Adventist message, refuse to relinquish the two golden calves of the Immortality of the Soul and Sunday sacredness. [see Protestantism]
|||Jerusalem||The exalted city for Literal Israel where the temple of God was erected, and portrayed in the parable as God's vineyard (Matthew 21:33); symbol of Spiritual Israel who themselves make up the temple of God; the Seventh-day Adventist Church at the end of the world (Luke 21:24; Exodus 25:8; 2 Corinthians 6:16-18; Isaiah 29:1, 9-16). [see Zion; Drunkards of Ephraim]
|||Jew (Spiritual)||One who has accepted the everlasting covenant of Righteousness by Faith in the atoning work of Jesus Christ (Romans 2:26-29; 4:6-17; 9:30-33; 10:3, 4); those who are circumcised of the heart and not the flesh (Deut 10:16; Jeremiah 9:25, 26; Romans 2:28, 29); A member of the twelve (spiritual) tribes of Israel that will inherit the kingdom (James 1:1; Rev 7:4); Jesus is the King of the Jews (Matthew 27:11)
|||Jewels (God's)||The redeemed, the saints of God who fear Him make up God's jewels. Those who are found faithful will be God's precious stones in His crown (Malachi 3:14-18; Zechariah 9:16). The gathering of His jewels is coincident with the Investigative Judgment, when Jesus "commends" the righteous and He receives His kingdom (Daniel 7:9, 14; Luke 17:21; 23:42; Matthew 10:32, 33) [see Ensign; Investigative Judgment; Maranatha Chapter 312 by EGW]
|||Jewelry and Make-up||Used to allure men (Proverbs 6:23-26; 2 Kings 9:30; Revelation 2:20); objects of pride and self-exaltation; outward adornment masking inward spiritual shallowness (Exodus 33:5, 6; Isaiah 3:16-24; 1 Peter 3:3, 4); identifying adornment of a harlot (Proverbs 7:10; Ezekiel 23:40-45; Hosea 2:13; Revelation 17:4).
|||Jezebel||Meaning "I belong to Baal", wicked wife of Ahab, King of Israel (Samaria), of Phoenician origin. Jezebel wore the pants in her marriage and sought to make her native pagan religions and idolatry the religion of Israel. By persecuting and killing the prophets of God she thought to do away with Jewry. Prophetically in type, Jezebel plays the role of the Beast in the threesome power of Dragon, Beast and False Prophet. Spiritually, a symbol of the apostate Church of Rome which introduced its harlotries (idolatrous/pagan worship) to sway the church of God "to fornication and eating foods sacrificed to idols" (1 Kings 16:30, 31; 18:4, 13: 19-21; Revelation 2:20-23). [see Woman (Harlot Woman), Abomination of Desolation, Thyatira]
|||Justification by Faith||[see Righteousness by Faith, Vision (mar'eh: Hebrew)]
|||Justified||To be pronounced not guilty through the act of contrition, afflicting one's soul and genuinely and sincerely asking for forgiveness of sin. Jesus mercifully does not condemn us when we come to Him sincerely, asking for His pardon (Luke 18:10-14; Leviticus 16:29, 30; John 8:1-11)
|||Kedar (sons of)||Kedar was the second son born to Ishmael, and is the forefather of the Arabians (Genesis 25:13; 1 Chronicles 1:29; Isaiah 21:13-17; Ezekiel 27:21). The sons of Kedar, called "the sons of the east" are a wealthy nation that dwell with no gates or bars and are alone (Jeremiah 49:28-33). They are said to be men who hate peace and love war (Psalm 120:5, 6).
|||Keys of the kingdom||All of the words and testimonies of Jesus Christ found within the Bible, having "power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will" (Revelation 11:4-6). The Apostles and followers of Christ throughout time are to bear these "keys" which when embraced with fear and trembling will bind their hearts to the Lord both here on earth and in heaven, but for the unbelieving and cowardly, they are loosed from their promised blessings both here on earth and in heaven. "The keys of the kingdom of heaven are the words of Christ. All the words of Holy Scripture are His, and are here included. These words have power to open and to shut heaven. The keys declare the conditions upon which men are received or rejected. Thus the work of those who preach God's word is a savor of life unto life or death unto death. Theirs is a mission weighted with eternal results." (Matthew 16:14-19, 18:17-20; Mark 6:7-13; EGW, The Desire of Ages, pp. 413, 414). [see Two Lamp Stands]
|||King||A kingdom, the territory for which a king rules (Daniel 2:37, 38)
|||Kings of the Earth||Political Leaders; world governments and powers
|||King of the North/North Country/King of Assyria||Assyria is geographically north of Palestine. Assyria in time would be displaced and conquered by Babylon (Ezekiel 26:7; Jeremiah 25:9); spiritually symbolic of the Devil working through the Papal System [Spiritual & Modern Babylon] that seeks to usurp the place of Christ. Jesus and the Father sit on the farthest sides of the North in heaven, the place where Lucifer sought to sit (Dan 11:19-45; Jeremiah 46:10; Ezekiel 26:7; Isaiah 14:12-14); the earthly king of the north will meet his end when the true King of the North, Jesus Christ, stands up to reign (Psalm 48:2; Daniel 12:1; Isaiah 14:4, 12-15; 48:10; Micah 5:5, 6). [see Assyrian; King Stands Up]
|||King of the South||Spiritually Sodom & Egypt (Rev 11:8) = Atheism (Genesis 12:9, 10; Exodus 5:1, 2; Dan 11:40) - a spiritual war started in 1793 in France against the Papacy that morphed/moved to the Soviet Union after the Bolshevik Revolution; he who would be toppled by military and economic forces (Daniel 11:40). King of the Assyrians (Isaiah 10:-12; Zephaniah 2) [See Beast from the Abyss, Egypt]
|||King Stands Up (Arises)||Change of kingdom or regime, or beginning of a new kingship (Daniel 8:23; 11:1-3); Marking the end of a probationary period (pleading/intercession) and execution of judgment (Daniel 12:1; Acts 7:55; Esther 7:7 - compare Mark 16:19; Heb 1:3; 12:2; Isaiah 3:13; 66:15, 16); Beginning of a new dispensation (Acts 7:55; Isaiah 60:1-3, 28:21; Daniel 12:1; Psalm 132:8). [see "Pass by"]
|||Kingdom of God||God's eternal Kingdom of Righteousness whose Author and Finisher is Jesus Christ. The Kingdom of God is built upon the Rock, Jesus Christ who is the Chief Cornerstone of the spiritual temple that replaced the earthly temple that merely served as a type (1 Peter 2:1-10). Jesus plainly stated that the Kingdom of God comes not with observation, but rather the Kingdom of God is within each believer. (Luke 17:20, 21). [see Law and the Prophets (The)]
|||Kinsman Redeemer||One who is near in kin willing to "raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place" (Ruth 4:5, 10). In other words, one would sacrifice his own inheritance, his own name, and his own posterity to raise-up (atone/restore/perpetuate) that of another so it ceases not from being. So, Jesus is the Kinsman Redeemer of humanity, having given up His inheritance, His name and yielding His Godly prerogatives to take on the form of a man and suffer death for man that He may raise-up many to eternal life (Philippians 2:5-10). Jesus is ever Immanuel, one with mankind and God with us (Isaiah 7:14; 1 John 4:2)!
|||Kishon (river)||River where slaughter is made near the city of Megiddo (Judges 5:19-21; Sisera was defeated here (Judges 4:7, 13) and Elijah slays the wicked prophets of Baal at the River Kishon; these stories foreshadow the slaughter to be held, spiritually at Armageddon (1 Kings 18:40; Psalm 83:8) [see Armageddon]
|||Ladder||Jesus Christ is the ladder or bridge between heaven and earth who seals our redemption and restores reconciliation between God and man. A symbol of a channel of constant communication kept with heaven and mankind on earth (Genesis 28:12, 13; John 1:51) [see Angel]
|||Lake of Fire||Also called Hell Fire, the final place of burning for the devil, his angels and the wicked. The earth itself will be entirely engulfed with fire which will purify it of sin. The burning with fire and brimstone will continue without ceasing until sin and the wicked are completely consumed and nothing more remains but ashes (Matthew 3:17, 25:41; Malachi 4:3; Ezekiel 28:18, 19).
|||Lamb of God; Lamb w/ 7 Horns and 7 eyes||Jesus Christ, the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. Jesus is the antitypical Lamb for which all sacrifices pointed. His sacrificial death for the sins of all men makes atonement for the offended Law of God. The blood of this Lamb, unlike that of mere animals has the power to cleans and provide forgiveness for all sins (John 1:29; Hebrews 9:11-13, 22; Rev 5:6-14, 19:7)
|||Lamb w/ 2 Horns, Speaks as a Dragon||Lamb, a symbol of Jesus Christ, is the characteristic of this world power and in appearance projects the tenets of Jesus; yet when it opens it's mouth (government decrees its purpose), it espouses the tenets of the Dragon power. A symbol of the United States of America (Rev 13:11-13); two horns indicate youth, innocence, and gentleness, all of which will be relinquished when he speaks as a Dragon with the erection of the image to the beast.
|||Lamp||The Bible (Matthew 25:5-7; Psalm 119:105); a church (Revelation 1:20). God establishes His last day church during the era of the Budding Leaves of Spring, when the Latter Rain is falling (Psalm 132:17; Isaiah 62:1-3). [see Budding Leaves of Spring, Latter Rain, Number #144,000]
|||Laodicea (Church of)||The 7th of seven prophetic churches described in the Revelation, denoting an era of the Christian Church history. Meaning "a people that are judged", Laodicea is the church that has backslidden (become briers and thorns) and lost its course from its predecessor, Philadelphia, a church on fire for the Lord. This last day church (1844AD+) is characterized as increased with the world's goods but has lost its spiritual compass, not recognizing its perilous condition of blindness, poverty, wretchedness, and being naked (Zephaniah 1:14-2:2). This is the church under which the Investigative Judgment is being made and is to be the last church, bearing a specific message to the world [the Three Angel's Message with the Fourth Angel] before the coming of Christ. God must revive the dead, very dry bones of this church (Ezekiel 37:1-14) by way of the Latter Rain from the Holy Spirit to raise-up a mighty army to accomplish His final work (Revelation 3:14-19; Isaiah 27:2-10). [see Lukewarm; Latter Rain; Three Angels' Message]
|||Last End of the Indignation||The conclusion of the second time of scattering ending on October 22, 1844, a period lasting seven-times (2520 years) determined upon the Nation of Israel and foretold in the prophecies of Moses (Leviticus 26). The commencement of the second time of scattering was through the captivity of King Manasseh of Judah by the Assyrians (The King of the North), the rod of God's anger in 677B.C. The captivity of Manasseh marked the gradual decline of the Southern Kingdom until its captivity and scattering by the Babylonians (The successor to the Assyrians as the King of the North) under Nebuchadnezzar in 607B.C. The Last End of the Indignation signals the restoration of God'stemple that had been trodden down so that it may be cleansed, commencing the Antitypical Day of Atonement (Daniel 8:19, 13, 14). [see Indignation (the Lord's); First End of the Indignation]
|||Latter Days||the time of the end; the time period spoken of by all the prophets where God's works of Redemption would be completed, Jesus' kingdom gathered in, the mystery of godliness would be completed and revealed in the sons of men and Jesus would make all of His enemies His footstool. It is at this time that the words of the prophets will "stand in their lot" (Hosea 3:1-5; Daniel 8:26, 27; 12:12, 13; 1 Corinthians 10:11). [see Time of the End]
|||Latter Rain||Commencing as a sprinkling to bring forth the budding of the trees in Spring, but coming forth without measure at Harvest time, rains and hail from on high bringing the crops to full maturity before being reaped (Joel 2:23; Isaiah 32:15-17, 55:10, 11; Revelation 14:14-16); symbolic of the outpouring of God's Holy Spirit [a Person] upon His corporate body [being baptized with fire], right before the 2nd Coming of Christ (Zechariah 10:1, Isaiah 55:1-13). It is the work of the Latter Rain [an experience/a message] that causes the trees to bud in spring before the summertime harvest, the wilderness to become a fruitful field and the fruitful field to be counted for as a forest (Isaiah 32:15-20; Luke 21:29-32; 62:10, 11). Everyone must however, receive the Early Rains in their personal Christian experience to receive the Latter Rain (James 5:7, 8). We must be seeking righteousness and meekness by sowing, reaping and breaking the fallow ground of our hearts before the decree is given and the Lord's anger is displayed (Zephaniah 2:3, Hosea 10:12; Jeremiah 4:3, 4). Just as manna rained down from heaven covering the earth for ancient Israel and it was asked "what is it", so the Latter Rain will fall and the Laodicean church of the End Time will ask "what is it". All who are in Christ must ask and plead for the Latter Rain in their lives and the Lord will make bright clouds and bring them forth abundantly (Zechariah 10:1). The Sunday Law per the parable of the Sower will test the children of God and reveal how much moisture each has received from the Latter Rains (Hosea 10:12). [see Budding Leaves of Spring; Times of Refreshing; Former Rain; In Measure; Water (of life)2; Fire (God's); Shaking; Laodicea (Church of); Spirit of Prophecy Vol 3 Chpt XVIII]
|||Law and the Prophets (The)||A term used frequently by Jesus Christ and other New Testament writers signifying the writings of the Old Testament, inclusive of the Decalogue, the Law of Moses [the Ceremonial Laws fulfilled in Jesus Christ; Laws of Health & Hygiene; Social Laws], the writings of the Prophets and the historical records given. Also, spoken of as the Law and Testimonies, the prophet Isaiah writes, "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, [it is] because [there is] no light in them" (Isaiah 8:20), stating that the Laws and Testimonies are the only standard of truth and wisdom for the Christian. Jesus claims that in no wise are the Law and Prophets done away with but are fulfilled, made plain and understandable, made practical, and made attainable by all through Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The teachings of the Law and the Prophets were misused by the Jewish Leadership to promote a theology based on salvation by works until the coming of John the Baptist, who taught a ministry of repentance and righteousness by faith in God's soon to appear Messiah. Jesus further states that the Law and the Prophets were preached until John, after which the "Kingdom of God" had been preached and every man presseth into it (Luke 16:16). Christ reemphasized this point, having demonstrated "the righteousness of God without [outside of] the law..., being witnessed by the law and the prophets" when He counseled " Come unto me, all [ye] that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest". Those who by faith accepted John's message of repentance for the forgiveness of sins (the message of the Law and the Prophets) were also those who readily accepted the Kingdom of God in Jesus Christ. Similarly, those who rejected John the Baptist's message also rejected Jesus and His message. God further displayed the permanence of the Law and Prophets upon the Mount of Transfiguration, where Moses [the giver of the Law] and Elijah [the greatest of the Old Testament Prophets] appeared to Jesus to encourage Him before His glorification upon the Cross. This appearance of Moses and Elijah was to encourage the disciples as well, that Jesus' soon approaching death was all a part of God's great Plan of Redemption (Isaiah 8:16, 20; Matthew 5:17, 7:12, 11:13, 28-30, 22:40; Luke 16:16, 24:44; John 1:45; Acts 13:14-16, 24:14, 28:23; Romans 3:20-22; 1 Corinthians 14:21). [see Kingdom of God; Spirit and in Truth]
|||Leaven||Fermentation (of wine) = false doctrine, hypocrisy, corruption, sin. Jesus warned the church of His time and the Last Day church to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, in so doing, He was warning of the two heresies that would be a scourge to the faith legalism and denying the power of God and the Spirit of Prophecy. Paul, when describing his former life before conversion spoke of himself as being a Pharisee of Pharisees, holding principally to the Law without regard to mercy and grace (Philippians 3:5,6). Similarly, Jesus scolded the Sadducees in their hardness of heart, unbelief and denying the power of God to raise the dead (Matthew 16:1, 22:23). In similar fashion, there will be those in the Last Day church who through legalism will make a mockery of the gospel of Christ and there will be others who in unbelief will deny the power of God, the testimonies through the Spirit of Prophecy and will make a shipwreck of their faith and others. (Matthew 16:5-12; Luke 12:1; 1 Corinthians 5:7, 8; Galatians 5:7-9). [see Wine (Old)]
|||Leaves (only, no fruit)/Leaves of Profession||The condition of the fig tree where Jesus sought fruit, but it boar leaves only, having no fruit (Matthew 21:18, 19). These are "leaves of profession" - profession, pretense, hollow formalism, or outward show of piety without true heart conversion, yielding fruit of righteousness. The same are also referred to as clouds and wind without rain (Proverbs 25:14, Jude 1:12); and wells without water (2 Peter 2:17). These are they who are as tares, sown among the wheat who when instructed to read and ingest [eat] the book and its message, refuse to even attempt to read, claiming that it is sealed and cannot be understood or that they are not learned and cannot understand (Isaiah 29:9-14). [see Tares, Foolish (the)/Wicked (the)]
|||Leviathan||The crooked piercing serpent that dwells in the sea is none other than the Devil, the serpent of old that deceives the whole world. In the day of the Lord, He will punish the Devil with His sword. (Isaiah 27:1; Genesis 3:1-15; Revelation 12:7-9)
|||Libya||A symbol for a poor nation, in contrast to Ethiopia, the rich (Daniel 11:43); the armies of the poor nations (Jeremiah 46:9)
|||Light [walking/dwelling in]||Spiritual wisdom; truth; righteousness; godliness (Eph 5:8-21; Matthew 5:14-16; John 8:12). [see ? Darkness (walking/dwelling in)] Light (The True/Great): The True Light that gives light to the world is Jesus Christ and His Word, the Bible. (Matthew 4:16; John 1:4, 5, 7-9; 3:19-21; John 5:36; 8:12; 9:5; 12:35, 36, 46;) Light (A Lesser): The ministry of John the Baptist in the time of Christ that lit the path for those "that sat in darkness and dwelt in the shadow of death" to guide their feet to the way of peace, Jesus Christ. John's message complimented the message of the True Light, Jesus Christ, preparing the hearts of the people to receive Jesus. Had the people not fallen into such gross darkness, there would not have been a need for the lesser light. Those who accepted John's ministry were willing to accept the message of Christ but those that hardened their hearts to John, the same also hardened their hearts to Jesus (Matt 17:12, 13; 21:32). Similarly, at the commencement of the Time of the End, William Miller's ministry fulfilled the ministry of John the Baptist, where he ministered to a people coming out of gross darkness (the Dark Ages) and served as a lesser light, leading men back to an understanding of the Bible and prophecy. Further the writings of Ellen White are as a microscope, expounding and making more visible the writings of the True Light, the Word of God, to bring clarity of Last Day Events before the coming of the Great Day of the Lord (Luke 1:76-80; John 5:33-35). [see Light (The True/Great)]
|||Lightning||Speed; swiftness. Spoken regarding the swiftness with which Islam moves/strikes (Matthew 24:27, compare Malachi 3:1).
|||Little Book (The)||The book of Daniel, once sealed and whose prophecies were reserved for those living at the Time of the End (Daniel 12:4, 9), has been opened by Jesus Christ Himself and its message given to the world by way of Christ's remnant church (Revelation 10:1-11). The prophetic details and writings of Daniel are to be eaten by all sincere believers as they hold warnings of last day events to occur before the close of judgment and Christ's Second Coming (Ezekiel 3:1-17; Revelation 10:10) . [see Bitter/Sweet, Time of the End, Watchmen]
|||Lion (of the Tribe of Judah)||Jesus Christ, who prevails and takes the scroll (Bible) from the hand of the Father and opens the seven seals. Christ is also the mighty Angel who descends from heaven, stands on land and sea [symbolic of the bounds of His authority and the breadth for which His message will be proclaimed] with the little book and roars like a lion (Isaiah 42:13), followed by the utterance of seven thunders. Jesus' role as Lion of the Tribe of Judah [King of Kings] is to reveal hidden truths in the Bible obscured by men's traditions and misinterpretations. It is the Lion's roar which is the prophetic message associated with the close of human probation encapsulated in the events of the 1st and 2nd Angel's Messages. (Revelation 5:5; 10:3; Amos 3:6-8) [see Seals (seven), Book (sealed)]
|||Lion (by the way)||Satan, the enemies of souls is called in the Bible the serpent, a dragon and a lion that walks about, seeking whom he may destroy. the lion that kills the Man of God, the prophet sent by God from Judah to warn Jeroboam (Apostate Protestantism) of his apostasy. The lion represents the King of the North or Modern Babylon that tears and slays the man of God, Adventism, that has in rebellion to God, drank the water and eaten the bread of the False Prophet of Bethel. (1 Kings 13; Isaiah 28:1, 29:9-14). [see Jeroboam, son of Nebat, Water, Bread (corn/grain), Ass by the way]
|||Lion (from the north)||the nation of Babylon, whose horses are as swift as eagles that descend upon the adulterous Nation of Israel as punishment for their whoredom (Jeremiah 4:5-13, 5:15-17). [see Hireling]
|||Living Creatures (Four)||Four Cherub Angels described by the prophet Ezekiel as having four wings, with two they covered their bodies and with two they flew. They also had four faces, the face of a man a lion, an ox and an eagle. These Four Living Creatures stand in the presence of the Lord and sing His praises continually. They are also seated around the throne of God with the Elders redeemed from the Earth when the 144,000 sing their song that none others can sing. They are described as having four faces and having eyes all over their bodies. (Ezekiel 1, 10:15-22; Revelation 14:3)
|||Living Waters (Springs of)||Running springs or rivers that brought refreshing to all who partook of them. Unlike dead (still) waters that would become murky with time with inactivity, living waters brought life and were highly sought after. Jesus is the Fountain, the source of the Living Waters from the Holy Spirit that bursts into life everlasting for the believer who partakes of them. Jesus counsels all who are thirsty to drink deeply from these springs that we may have life and may impart life to those around us (Revelation 22:17). [see Water; Water (of life); Fountain for Sin and Uncleanness]
|||Locust||symbolic of that which destroys economic strength, causes darkness, casting out the Sun (of Righteousness), covers and desolates the earth and marches in ranks as an army (Joel 1:4, 2:2-11, 25). An end time symbol of Islam, the descendants of Ishmael inhabiting the east who prophetically were to dwell among their own and be a scourge to all men upon the earth (Genesis 16:11, 12). The locusts that served as a plague to Egypt (the world) in the time of the exodus were brought by the East Wind, they darkened the land, and were said to be unlike any other scourge of locust before or ever after. Prophetically, the scourge of locusts spoken of in Revelation 9:1-11 that proceeds from the Bottomless Pit, warring Islam, would also scourge the earth through "terrorism" (Exodus 10:12-15 ; Revelation 9:1-10). [see Horse (Wild Arabian Ass); Woes (three)2.1; East Wind; Ships of Tarshish; Bottomless Pit; Hireling; Darkness]
|||Lost Sheep (of the House of Israel)||the condition of Israel before the close of their probation and the condition of Adventism before the Unrighteous Decree is passed. The people are characterized as having a lukewarm condition; having no shepherd to lead them and therefore wandering aimlessly and vulnerably; being misled and deceived by false prophets that speak a peace and safety message and not aware of their eminent peril. The final message of warning is given to first to the Lost Sheep of the House of Israel before their probation closes and the message is finally given to the world (Jeremiah 50:6,7; Mark 6:34; Matthew 10:5-7, 14-18). [see Laodicea (Church of);]
|||Loud Cry||Prophetic parallel to the Millerite Movement's Midnight Cry at the very end of time. A message typified prophetically when the Third Angel of Revelation 14:9 is joined by the Fourth Angel of Revelation 18:1-6 in appealing to flee the apostate religious system before punishment is levied upon it. The message produces Refreshing Rains brought on by eating of the Little Book, causing hearers to raise up the foundations of former generations (Isaiah 28:12, 13; 58:12; 1 Kings 18:30, 37-39; 41-45) shout for joy (Psalm 132:8, 9) and to flee from the corruptions of Spiritual Babylon as made plain in the third angel's message (Revelation 18:1-5; 14:8-12; Jonah 3:1-4). [see Midnight Cry, Shut Door Message, Times of Refreshing, "Paths to Dwell in"]
|||Lukewarm||The spiritual condition of the Laeodecian Church which is typified with a complacency with one's spiritual condition, a false sense of security in a shallow relationship with Christ, love for the world (increased with goods), a manifest sense of self-righteousness despite one's spiritual blindness. The condition of being lukewarm is to be neither hot nor cold, therefore adding no therapeutic influence to the sin sick world around you. Jesus finds this condition particularly detestable and desires that His followers become and remain either Hot or Cold by the transforming influence of the Holy Spirit, by taking on Christ's garments of righteousness, by faith tried in the fire as gold, and the application of eye salve to cure the spiritual blindness (Revelation 3:14-19). [see Laodicea, Blindness/Deafness (Spiritual), Spiritualism: Transformism; ? Hot or Cold, Gold (tried in fire), Garments (whitened)/Cloth (New)]
|||Magog||see Gog
|||Ma-her-shal'-al-hash'-baz||Name of the second son of Isaiah the prophet whose name was appointed by God meaning "Make(ing) speed to the spoil he hasteneth the prey (booty)". This prophetic name was to give courage and warning to the people of Judah of Syria, Israel, and their own impending judgment to befall them at the hands of the Assyrians. Because of their idolatry, seeking of false gods, pride and self-assurance, the Lord would make Ephraim and Judah easy prey for their adversaries. Yet God promised deliverance to those who made the Lord their fear and dread and who "bound up the testimony and sealed the law in their hearts". The name Ma-her-shal'-al-hash'-baz and his brother's name denote the scattering and gathering respectively pronounced upon God's people as part of the covenant blessings and curses spoken in Leviticus 25 and 26 (Isaiah 8; 9:8-12). [see She-r-jash'-ub, Bee of Assyria, Scatter]
|||Man of God||The central figure in the story told in 1 Kings 13. The Man of God, called to be a watchman of God, is a prophet of God sent from the southern kingdom Judah, where God was worshipped per His commandments. He is sent to bring a message of pending doom and punishment to the King of the northern kingdom (King of the North), Jeroboam, son of Nebat. The Man of God is a fit representation of Adventism in the last days in his message and his works, yet more specifically, he represents the portion of Adventism that will eventually be overthrown due to its final compromise and conformity to the ways of the world and Apostate Protestantism. The works of the man of God that represent Adventism are as follows:
  1. He condemns the works of apostasy and rebellion in Israel, the Northern Kingdom (Apostate Protestantism) that has gone astray from its knowledge of God, keeping a counterfeit Sabbath. Intruth the Man of God typifies the Three and Fourth Angel's Messages to Jeroboam and His kingdom
  2. He stumbles in not adhering to the counsels of God by finding rest and repose in the forbidden land, rather than fleeing to the safety of Jerusalem ("Babylon is Fallen is Fallen, Come out of her my people..." - 2nd & 4th Angel's Message)
  3. He is deceived by the craftiness of the False Prophet who claims to worship the same God he serves. He listens to the counsels of the False Prophet (Apostate Protestantism) and is lured to his home rather than heeding the straight word of the Lord.
  4. He stumbles and falls by eating bread and wine at the hands of the False Prophet, though God forbade him to neither eat nor drink in the forbidden land. By eating and drinking of the foods of the land, he embraced the doctrines of the land. So too, Adventism, rather than eating of its own bread (doctrine) will return to the bread of Babylon (apostate Protestantism) [see Daily (The)]
  5. He is overthrown by the Lion by the way (King of the North) and his dead body will lie as a witness against his rebellion before the Ass by the way (Dragon - Spiritualism) and the False Prophet.

The object lesson of the Man of God is a message of warning for Spiritual Israel, God's denominated people in the last days [see Jeroboam, son of Nebat; Ass by the way; Lion by the way; False Prophet (the); overthrown; Drunkards of Ephraim]
|||Mark of the Beast (the)||1. Counterfeit of the Seal of God (Ezekiel 20:12, 20; Exodus 20:8-11); 
2. The symbol of the Beast Power's authority (Daniel 7:25; Rev 13:5, 6; 2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4); 
3. Distinguishing mark given to those who do not honor or worship the true God through their thoughts or deeds (those who spiritually choose Barabbas over Jesus Christ). The enemy of souls seeks our worship whether by choice (receiving the mark in the forehead) or by force (receiving the mark in the hands). [see Shaking, Hour of Temptation, Overthrown, ? Seal (of God)]
|||Marriage Supper of the Lamb||Jesus, before His glorification on the Cross, told His disciples that he would not drink of the fruit of the vine until He drink it with them in His Father's kingdom (Matthew 26:29). This celebratory feast in heaven for the redeemed of God who have made themselves ready through Christ, commences the Millennial period in heaven where the redeemed will take part in judging Satan, his angels and all those that have spurned Christ's free gift of salvation (Revelation 19:1-9; 20:4-6). [see
|||Measure||To judge, to study (Matthew 7:1, 2; Revelation 11:1). [see ? Supper of the Great God]
|||Measure with a Rod; Search with a Candle; Weighed in the Balances||To examine or study; A symbol for an investigative judgment (Rev 11:1, 2; Zephaniah 1:12; Daniel 5:27) before an executive judgment.
|||Measure the temple of God||The command given to John the Revelator to prophetically foreshadow the Millerite Movement of 1844 that had been awaken to the truth of judgment, but knew not the ways of God in His sanctuary (Rev 11:1-3; Zechariah 4:1-5). The prophecy is foretold in Zechariah where he is shown the objects in the temple of God but has no knowledge of them. The Lord replies by stating that the work of spreading the message to the world will begin and be completed, not by strength nor might of men, but by the power of the Holy Spirit. Zerubbabel (meaning "offspring of Babylon" or "one called out of Babylon") is said to have laid the foundation and the capstone on the temple, symbolizing the Holy Spirit's work of completing the building of the temple of God, the Church Triumphant (Zechariah 4:8-10). The command also foreshadows the commencement of an Investigative Judgment in heaven where the temple itself, alter and the people that worship there in are to be measured (judged). The judgment commences with the house of God and is then taken to the outer court that was given to the Gentiles to be trodden down until the end of 42months (Luke 21:20-24; Daniel 7:25, 8:10; 1 Peter 4:17). [see Investigative Judgment; Number #1260]
|||Meat||The Word of God, doctrine, teachings, a message; more advanced Bible truths that continue our Christian walk and growth (Matthew 24:45, 46; 1 Corinthians 2:12-3:9; 1 Peter 2:2). [see Milk]
|||Meat Offering||An offering of fine wheat flour mixed with oil and frankincense that is dedicated to the Lord in gratitude for His goodness. A portion of the offering is consecrated to the priests [Levites] for their use as ministers before the Lord (Leviticus 2:1-3)
|||Megiddo||Valley near the River Euphrates where spiritually the wicked war against the forces of God (2 Chron 35:20-22). Hebrew for slaughter, part of the compound word har-megiddo or mountain of the slaughter. [see Armageddon]
|||Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsen||Numerical handwriting written on the walls of Belshazzar's palace during a blasphemous ceremony mocking the God of heaven (Daniel 5). The interpretation given by God to the prophet Daniel is as follows:
  - Mene = 50 shekels = 1000 Gerahs
  - Mene = 50 shekels = 1000 Gerahs
  - Tekel (Shekel) = 1 shekel = 20 Gerahs
  - Peres = 25 shekels = 500 Gerahs
    SUM = 126 shekels = 2520 Gerahs
1 Shekel = 20 Gerahs, therefore, 20 *126=2520 Gerah; a Gerah is the smallest monetary weight used for metals (Ezekiel 25:12, Ex 30:13; Lev 27:25; Numbers 3:47; Numbers 18:16; Ezekiel 45:12). The number bears dual meanings of "scattering" or "a scattering followed by a gathering" depending on the context. In the case of Belshazzar, his kingdom was weighed and wanting, divided, numbered and finished! [see Number #2520]
|||Messenger (of God)||Jesus Christ! (Malachi 3:1-5) [see Shepherd (the Good), Sun of Righteousness]
|||Michael||A name meaning "[One] Who is like God", Michael is the name of the pre-incarnate Second Person of the God Head, the Word of God made flesh, also called Emmanuel, God with us - Jesus Christ. Before the creation of the world and humankind, God manifested Himself to the angels in heaven as an angel called Michael. Though fully God and the Author of all creation and life, He, the image of the invisible God and firstborn of every creature [including the angels], manifested Himself as the Angel of God to the heavenly hosts (Colossians 1:12-16). The verses that describe Michael in the Bible give evidence that Michael is more than a mere angel (a creation of God), but rather the Everlasting God Himself:
  - Michael is the archangel. The Greek word "arche" signifies the beginning, chief, leader, the original model of a thing, first, highest, supreme, or Creator, the One above all [i.e. archenemy, archetype]. Therefore, as archangel, Michael is unique, first and above all others. There can only be one archangel (Jude 1:9; 1 Thessalonians 4:16) 
  - Throughout the Bible, a question is offered in complete awe and reverence to the God of Creation, asking: "Who is like Thee [oh God]?" (Psalm 71:19, 89:8, 113:5; Micah 7:18). Captivated by every good superlative that God both defines and embodies [i.e. love, mercy, truth, just, etc.], the writers of the Bible under the influence of the Holy Spirit responded:
     "...The Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath..." 1 Kings 8:23; 2 Chronicles 6:14
     "O LORD, [there is] none like thee, neither [is there any] God beside thee..." 1 Chronicles 17:20
     "...that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the Lord our God." Exodus 8:10 (See also: Exodus 15:11; Deuteronomy 33:26; Isaiah 46:9; Isaiah 42:8; Jeremiah 10:7).
    These verses affirm that no being is equal to God; therefore, He (God) is beyond comparison! God further states that He in no wise will share His name [Lord], His glory, nor His praise with another (Isaiah 42:8; Psalm 148:13). With that said, the name "Michael", meaning "[One] Who is like God" would be either given in bold presumption and blasphemy (John 10:33; Luke 6:21) or in fact, Michael is God Himself!
    Jesus, the Prince of Life, while on earth demonstrated His power over death and His power to restore life by calling forth Lazarus from the dead (John 11:1-45; Acts 3:15). Jesus promised that the day would soon come when all who are in the grave will hear the voice of the Son of God and would come forth from the grave (John 5:24-29). Similarly, Paul writes that Jesus will descend from heaven on that day, with a shout, with the trumpet of God, and the voice of the archangel and the dead in Christ will rise first (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18). It is the voice of the archangel, Michael, Who is the same Jesus, that calls forth the dead from their graves Jesus is called a Prince [Ruler], as well as the Son of the Father who is the King of the Universe (Acts 3:15, 5:31; Revelation 1:5). Speaking of Himself, Jesus spoke parables of a nobleman who went away to a far country to receive a kingdom. Returning as a King he took inventory of His servants and how they made use of the talents entrusted to them (Matthew 25:14-46; Luke 19:12-27). Jesus is ruler over the sons of obedience (Genesis 6:2; Luke 3:23-38), just as Michael stands as Prince [ruler] over the sons of God (Daniel 10:13, 20, 21) [seePrince1]
    There is One ruler over heaven and earth, Jesus Christ. As such, He is captain over the heavenly hosts (armies). It was Jesus or Michael, and His loyal angels who confronted Lucifer head-on, expelling him and a third of the angels from heaven (Joshua 5:13-15; Revelation 12:7-9; Luke 10:17-20) The word angel in Latin means a messenger (Hebrews 1:7, 14). Jesus' purpose in coming to the earth among many, was as a messenger to reveal the true character of His Father to humankind: "he that hath seen me hath seen the Father" (John 14:7-11, 17:3-6). Therefore, Jesus, being God and possessing all the characteristics of the Father, is the Greatest Messenger (Angel) the Father could ever send to the world. The Angel of the Lord is a heavenly messenger often mentioned in the Old Testament Who is none other than Jesus Himself, taking a message to His people. [Note: the term "Angel of the Lord" is often used to refer to the pre-incarnate Second Person of the Godhead, Jesus, however, the term at times is used in the Bible about a mere angel (at times in lower case letters). The context of the verses must be thoroughly read and understood to determine whether the term applies to God or an angel]. One quality possessed by God alone is holiness, and therefore He alone is worthy of our worship (Revelation 15:4; Mark 1:23, 24; Revelation 19:1-10). Therefore, it is no surprise that where the Angel of the Lord appears, the surrounding area also becomes holy, and rightfully, He, the Angel of the Lord is to be worshipped as God. Consider the following cases related to the Angel of the Lord: Moses near the burning bush (Exodus 3:1-6); the Angel of the Lord before Joshua (Joshua 5:13-15); and the Angel of the Lord before Manoah and his wife (Judges 13:1-6, 11-23)
      1. God counsels men not to swear at all, neither by heaven nor by earth, but rather let our yes' be yes, and our no's be no (Matthew 5:34-37; James 5:12). We as frail, mortal beings are unable to do anything outside of God's purposes; therefore, He gives us this commandment. God however, is shown in the Bible often swearing because He has both the power and authority to perform that which He says He will do (Numbers 23:19; Hebrews 6:13, 14). Consider that it is the Angel of the Lord, God Himself, that calls to Abraham and swears by Himself that He will bless and fulfill the promises He had made to Abraham (Genesis 22:15-18; Hebrews 6:13, 14)
      2. Joshua the High Priest, standing before the Angel of the Lord and Satan standing at Joshua's right side, poised to accuse him to the Lord, portrays the two types that Jesus spoke of, namely, the sheep and the goat. The sheep who follow the Lamb wherever He goes stand before the Lord to His right, whereas the goat who murmur, butt, and do not the Lord's will are made to stand before the Lord to His left (Zechariah 3:1-3; Matthew 25:32-34, 41)
      3. The Angel of the Lord speaking to Joshua declares that He Himself (the Angel of the Lord) is the One Who takes away his sins, declaring him righteous. The Angel of the Lord therefore commands that Joshua's filthy garments be removed and clean garments be given to him. Jesus showed that as God, He has power to not only bring physical healing but to forgive sins. Therefore, by deduction, the Angel of the Lord must too be God. (Zechariah 3:3-5; Revelation 3:14-18; 6:9-11; 19:7-9; Malachi 3:1-4; Matthew 9:2-7)
  - The Father, speaking in type to David, commands His Son Jesus Christ to "Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool" (Psalm 110:1; Acts 2:34, 35; 1 Corinthians 15:22-28; Ephesians 1:15-23; Hebrews 1:13). Therefore, it is when all earthly powers have been judged and subdued that Jesus will stand up to inflict justice upon His enemies, based on His judgment of them (Malachi 4:1-3; Matthew 24:30, 31; John 5:26, 27; Revelation 14:15-20). Therefore, it is in that day that Jesus as Michael, will stand up, having judged the world, and stating "He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward [is] with me, to give every man according as his work shall be" (Revelation 22:11, 12; Daniel 12:1-3). Michael's standing up signals the end of a specific work of God, namely judgment, and the commencement of another work of God, namely punishment and restitution, based on His judgments. No such honor is given to an angel, that is, to herald the completed works of God. God Himself stands up, signifying His works of Redemption are come to their end.

When the Bible speaks of Michael, He is often seen in contest with the enemy of souls, Satan, defending humankind (Zechariah 3:1-3; Daniel 10:13, 21; Jude 1:9; Revelation 12:7-9). Michael is the Great Commander of God's Army, Jesus Christ, the Lord strong and might, the Lord mighty in battle, ready to defend the sons of God (Psalm 24:8).
|||Midnight||"In the summer of 1844, midway between the time when it had been first thought that the 2300 days would end, and the autumn of the same year, to which it was afterward found that they extended, the message was proclaimed in the very words of Scripture: "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!" {GC 398.3} - On July 21, 1844 Samuel Snow first presented the message that would become the Midnight Cry in Boston Massachusetts. The date marks the midpoint between the first disappointment on April 19, 1844 (based on Karaite Calendar reckoning of the dates) and the Great Disappointment on October 22, 1844. In the era of the 144,000, Midnight marks the point in time when the priests of Adventism have been sealed and the Levites are receiving the message for which they will be tested at the Midnight Cry. {See Midnight Cry}
|||Midnight Cry||Prophetic light at the beginning of the Adventist Movement's path, an experience recorded in Matthew 25:1-13 in the parable of the 10 Virgins where a sounding for the coming of the Lord is made. The experience of the Millerites at the Exeter Camp Meeting in August 1844, who through patient study and diligence under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit understood the coming of the Lord was eminent. Their impassioned cry spread throughout the world, creating a spiritual revival and calling God's faithful out of Babylon, the apostate Protestant churches. A foreshadowing of the Loud Cry to all the ends of the earth that will go out to gather the people of God for His Second Coming. [see Loud Cry, Philadelphia (Church of)]
|||Milk||The Word of God, doctrine, teachings, a message; fundamental Bible truths that advance our Christian walk (1 Corinthians 2:12-3:9; 1 Peter 2:2, Isaiah 28:9; 55:1-3) [see Meat, Wine, Butter and Honey/Milk & Honey]
|||Millstone at the Bottom of the Sea||the fate of Babylon when she is finally overthrown by the fury of the Lord (Exodus 15:5; Revelation 18:19; Jeremiah 51:60-64; Matthew 18:6)
|||Moabites (Moab)||Distant cousins to the Israelites whose name means "of/from my father", born of fornication/incest and perversion (Genesis 19:1-38). The pagan god of the Moabites was Chemosh or Baal, the noted god for sun worshippers. Those who have a knowledge of the true God but do not heed his commandments, pervert His truths, and are idolaters [spiritual fornicators]. Never were the sons of Ammon or Moab to enter into the congregation of God because they thought to curse Israel; yet, Ruth the Moabite woman who showed great courage, faith, and loyalty in denying the foreign gods of her fathers and embracing the God of Abraham, became a noted and significant pillar in the genealogy of Christ. This truth affirms that God is the God of all nations and people who chose to follow Him. (Ezekiel 25:8-11; Nehemiah 13:1, 2; Matthew 1:5). [see Ammonite, Edom, Ammon & Moab]
|||Modern Babylon||The threefold union of world religions that are influenced by spiritualism, apostate Protestantism, and the revived, reinvigorated continuation of the Roman Empire that was subdued and stripped of its political power when it received a deadly wound in 1798, the Papacy. The Papacy, the exalted city and nation will come to full power once again both politically and religiously with the enforcement of the Image to the Beast as portrayed in the workings of the King of the North (Daniel 11:40-45); she will sit as queen of the world once again and will not suffer the loss of children as she gathers in the world religions and apostate Protestantism (Revelation 18:7). The modern Papacy fulfills this prophetic revelation of the King of the North and the Beast whose deadly wound is healed (Revelation 13:3). [see Babylon (Mystery), Beast (leopard-like)]
|||Modern Egypt||The end time Dragon power (Revelation 16:13; Ezekiel 29:2, 3), a symbol of the entire world (worldwide confederacy) that shall not escape the hand of the King of the North but will be overthrown (Exodus 20:2; Daniel 11:42, 43). This prophecy given in Revelation 17:12-18 is fulfilled when the kings of the earth, under a One World Government (Genesis 41:5-57), give their power to the Beast for a season, only after the Image to the Beast has been established; reminiscent of the daily giving its power, seat, and authority to the Beast. The seven last plagues are to fall upon Modern Egypt just as 7 of 10 plagues of Ancient Egypt fell upon that land of Egypt exclusively, the Lord having guarded His people dwelling in the adjacent land of Goshen (Revelation 9:4, 16:1-21). [see Dragon4; Escape; Overthrown; Egypt (Land of); Daily (the)]
|||Modern Israel / Spiritual Israel / Spiritual Jerusalem||God's end-time church triumphant. The promises that once applied to the Nation of Israel are to be fulfilled in those who by faith in Jesus Christ, allow Him to live out His life within them (Romans 2:28, 29; Luke 21:24; Revelation 11:2, 3). [see Mystery (of Godliness), Horse (Goodly), Time of the Gentiles]
|||Moon||The New Testament (Rev 12:1; Psalm 119:105, 130; Matt 25:1-4); The Testimony of Jesus Christ which is the Spirit of prophecy which reflects the Sun, or the Word of God (Jesus Christ) in its entirety (Psalm 89:37; Isaiah 30:26).
|||Morning||Time of Revival and Reformation where light (wisdom), a health [message], righteousness, and God's glory are revealed in the sons and daughters of the Kingdom by power of the Holy Spirit (Hosea 6:1-3; Isaiah 58:6-8). [see ? Night, Times of Refreshing]
|||Morning Star (Bright and); Day Star||Jesus Christ (Revelation 22:16; 2 Peter 1:19)[see Sun of Righteousness]
|||Moses||faithful prophet of God with whom the Lord spoke face to face as with a friend. Called the meekest of men besides Christ, Moses who tasted death, typifies those in the Kingdom of God who too have tasted death but will be resurrected at Christ's 2nd Coming. Though Moses died due to his sin at the Waters of Meribah (Numbers 20:9-13) and was forbidden to enter the earthly Promised Land, the Lord God (Michael) in love and mercy resurrected him though contested by the devil (Jude 1:9), so that he may be with Him in the eternal Promised Land. [see Elijah]
|||Mount of Offense||The southern slope of Mt. Olivet, opposite Mt. Moriah where the temple of the Lord stood. Upon this slope, King Solomon built shrines to foreign gods in honor of his pagan wives [Prophets and Kings, by EGW pg 402.6]
|||Mount Sinai||Mountain range in Arabia where the Lord appeared to the Children of Israel in firey glory while traveling through the wilderness. The mountain is also where Moses received the Law from the hand of God. Mt Sinai is an allegory, representing the first covenant and therefore Ishmael, who was born of Hagar and Abram of the flesh. Those [in Israel] who continue to live in the flesh and not by the Spirit are they who uphold the Law as the means of righteousness, yet, in their feeble attempts to attain righteousness by the Law, they find condemnation; these are not Jews according to the Lord, but are rather bastards, outside the commonwealth of Israel and are to be sent away, not to receive an inheritance with the sons of promise. In contrast, Jerusalem (Mt. Zion) which is above, represents the second covenant and those born not of the will of man but born of the will of God and born of the Spirit. (Galatians 4:21-31; John 1:12, 13) [see Zion]
|||Mountain||A symbol for either a 1civil/political kingdom or government (Dan 2:35, 44; Rev 17:10, Isa 2:2, Jer 13:16, 17, 17:3; 31:23; 51:24, 25; Ezek 17:22, 23; Jeremiah 51:24, 25) or a 2church (Isaiah 2:2-4; 4:1; Dan 11:45)
|||Mountain (Glorious Holy or Great)||Remnant Church of God (Isa 2:2, 3, 25:6-8); Mount Zion (Daniel 2:35; Rev 14:1; Ezekiel 20:40). [see Zion]
|||Mountain of Offense||western side of Mt. Olivet, facing Mt Moriah and the temple of God where Solomon erected idolatrous statues and alters to worship the false gods of his wives. These statues and alters remained until Josiah tore them down during his reformatory works (PK 402.6).
|||Music (Godly, Holy)||That which is God ordained and God derived, used to give praise, thanksgiving, and honor to the true God of heaven and earth. The music and song speak of God's characteristics and works of salvation towards men. When done with sincerity and selflessness, God is exalted to His rightful position of honor, man is drawn to worship Him and heaven joins in chorus (1 Chronicles 16:9; Psalm 95:1-3; Ephesians 5:19, 20).
|||Music (Unrighteous, Unholy)||That which accompanies or incites false worship. The Bible illustrates that ungodly worship is often invoked by the sound of music and singing. A medium for channeling the spiritual counterfeit fire (counterfeit holy spirit) that is called down in the sight of men to deceive them through false signs and lying wonders by the Beast and False Prophet (Revelation 13:12. 13; 2 Thessalonians 2:3-12). The harlot Tyre [a symbol for the whore Babylon] is portrayed as singing and making sweet melody with harp by Isaiah the prophet (Isaiah 23:15-17) until she receives her deadly wound; but will engage in her adulterous acts with the kings of the world again, when her deadly wound is healed [Sunday Law]. (Daniel 3:1-7, 10, 14, 15; Exodus 32:1-6, 17, 18; 1 Kings 18:25-29). [see Fire (Strange); Spiritualism; False Prophet (the); Image to the Beast; Babylon (Mystery); Tyrus (Prince of)]
|||Mystery (of Godliness)||The mystery of God hidden from the foundation of the world but made manifest by the scriptures of the prophets and ordained by God (Romans 16:25, 26). God's purpose to dwell within men, restoring His perfect image in men by means of the Holy Spirit; Christ is manifest once again in the flesh through the redeemed- Righteousness by Faith. The Bible affirms that fulfillment of this truth en mass would be completed in time after 1844, during the sounding of the 7th trumpet (2 Peter 1:2-4; Colossians 1:25-29; Revelation 10:7); Christ's work of forming one man of Jew and Gentile by way of the gospel in Christ Jesus; God's work of Gathering His Sheep (John 10:16; Ephesians 1:9, 10; 2:11-12, 3:2-6; Colossians 2:23, 26, 27; Ezekiel 37:15-19)
|||Mystery (of Iniquity or Lawlessness)||Spirit of Lucifer that exalts itself above all that is called God or that is worshipped (2 Thessalonians 2:3-7; Isaiah 14:13, 14; 47:7, 8; Revelation 18:7). The workings of Satan to mix the holy with the unholy seed. This "amalgamation" is designed to bewitch, particularly those who have been given great light, so that they stumble and "fall away" from the truth into spiritual darkness. Consider the following examples of the "mystery of iniquity doth already work", the mixing of the holy and unholy seed:
  - Sons of God (descendants of Seth) took unto themselves the daughters of men (descendants of Cain), corrupting the holy seed - Genesis 6:1-5
  - The mixed multitude that accompanied the COI from Egypt were a continual thorn in the side to the COI. The mixed multitude was comprised of Egyptians and other foreigners, many of whom joined the exiting COI to escape the plagues of Egypt and in excited fervor to see what the entering in of the Promised Land would be. The mixed multitude were used by Satan to incite the COI into rebellion, particularly, the murmuring for meat in the wilderness, the rebellion of the golden calf, and the rebellion in not entering the Promised Land when the 12 spies returned. (Exodus 12:38)
  - Solomon's marrying many wives and introducing strange forms of worship among the Children of Israel (1 Kings 11:1-4)
  - The marrying of foreign women, especially among the leadership, after the Babylonian captivity - (Nehemiah 13:1-3)
  - Judas was an agent of Satan among Jesus' disciples (John 6:70) and was used often to controvert Jesus' words to the disciples and weaken their faith (i.e. - Judas stirred up the crowd to try to make Jesus king after feeding the 5000 (John 6:15); Judas stirred up contention among the disciples regarding who would be greatest in Jesus' kingdom; Judas murmured and chided Mary for anointing Jesus with costly oil)
  - The Church of Pergamos in the Revelation 2, the compromising church, typifies the historic "falling away" in Christianity that would bring forth the "man of sin and son of perdition", the papacy. The mixing of paganism with the true Christian faith, facilitated by the mixing of church and state, is the working of Satan with all signs, power and lying wonders.
  - Seventh-day Adventism's adoption of the worlds standards seen in:
    1. Higher education and men's philosophies being taught in Adventist institutions (books of a new order written and taught in our institutions) - {See Pamphlets, An Appeal to Missions (1898) - PH004 11.2} 
    2. Introduction of secular/worldly music in worship - celebration worship styleProphetic Symbols: Interpreting Bible Prophecy
    3. Adoption of traditional medical practices in our hospitals verses an emphasis on the health message being the entering wedge for the gospel, emphasis on lifestyle change among patients, the use of modern medicines at the exclusion of natural remedies, and other wholistic medical treatments
|||Naked (to be)||1. Not having (covered with) Christ's righteousness; an unconverted character or mind; to be found with a sinful/rebellious nature; selfish in nature and self-justifying/self-righteous; Adam and Eve hid from God because they were naked (Rev 16:15; Gen 3:7-11; Isaiah 64:6, 7); to be clothed in strange apparel at the time of the close of probation (Rev 3:18; Zephaniah 1:8; Genesis 35:1, 2; 2 King 10:18-25; Matthew 22:11-13) [see Garments]
2. Naked (to be) = to be physically dead. Paul compares being "clothed" in our earthly house [our natural, un-restored bodies marred by sin] to being "clothed" in our heavenly house [spiritual, eternal, immortal bodies] to being naked, or dead, without a house. (2 Corinthians 5:1-4; 1 Corinthians 15:35- 58). [see Sleep]
|||Name||A representation of character (Rev 3:12; 9:11)
|||Nations were Angry||An end-time prophetic parallel to the Distress of Nations (Luke 21:25) where the nations of the earth are enraged by an act brought about by the same power that caused distress, radical Islam. Part of the predictions of the third Woe [seventh trumpet] and occurring September 11, 2001, the nations of the world placed a restraint on radical Islam [suspending its bank accounts, seizing its properties and declaring war against it] whose hands were against the world and the world's hands against it. The Angering of the Nations, based on the Adventist Pioneer understanding, is indicative of the Third Woe and therefore confirming a triple application of prophecy. The time of the Angering of the Nations signals the descent of the 4th Angel of Revelation 18:1 who will in time issue the Loud Cry message. The Nations were Angry is prophetically followed by the wrath of God and the time of the judgment of dead (Revelation 11:18). [see East Wind, "Distress of Nations", Loud Cry, Woes (three)2-3]
|||New Jerusalem||God's celestial city in heaven where Jesus has gone to prepare a place for all who will receive His eternal salvation (John 14:1-3). Comprised of 12 gates of pearls, 12 foundations of precious stones and made entirely of gold, the chosen and faithful who enter this city must have left the counterfeit golden city of Babylon (Revelation 21:9-27; 18:1-4; Isaiah 14:4). The city, whose spiritual walls and bulwarks are salvation, remains uninhabited until Jesus returns to receive the jewels of His crown (Isaiah 26:1, 2; Malachi 3:16-18)[see ? Babylon (Mystery)]
|||Night||The time when no more work can be done for the Kingdom of God, the end of Probation. The era when there shall be no more visions (John 9:4; Micah 3:5-7). [see Closed Door, ? Morning]
|||Nineveh||A capital city of the Assyrian empire, known for its wickedness, witchcraft, and ruthlessness This great city would be once warned of its harlotries and witchcrafts and would repent. However, in time it would return to its ruthless practices and God would raze it from the earth (Nahum 1-3; Jonah 3).
|||North||direction relative to Palestine, associated with Assyria and Babylon (Jeremiah 1:13-16, 25:9; Ezekiel 26:7); Direction from which great earthly destruction and evil, the sword of God's wrath, originates (Jeremiah 6:1); the direction where God's heavenly throne is located; pivotal direction where the Great Controversy is waged and the Plan of Salvation is orchestrated (Isaiah 14:12, 13). [ see Assyria/Assyrian; Bread (of Life)]
|||Number #1||Unity (John 10:30; Ephesians 4:5; 1 John 5:7)
|||Number #3||Strength of God: A threefold cord is not easily broken (Ecclesiastes 4:12); 3 names written upon the overcomers (Rev 3:12); 3 Angel's Message (Rev 14:6-12); Number of Trial and Perfection: Mary and Joseph sorrowed for 3 days as they lost Jesus, returning from the annual Passover festival, only to rejoice once He was found. This sorrow was to prepare Mary for the 3 days of grief (the sword piercing through her soul) she would experience later in life when Jesus was again lost to her for three days, offered up as the Lamb of God. Her sorrow would turn to joy 3 days later at His resurrection.
|||Number #3.5||A prophetic reference to half of a week or 1260 prophetic days - a time, times, and dividing of time (See Revelation 11:11; 2:21; James 5:17). God's Two Witnesses' bodies would lie in the streets of atheistic France for 3.5days after which they would be resurrected. This 3.5days (~1260) coupled with the Two Witness' ministry of 1260days typifies the 1-week in which Christ fulfilled His covenant with His people.
|||Number #4||1.Number signifying the earth: 4 directions of the compass (Zechariah 2:6; Revelation 7:1); 4 ingredients in the showbread; 4 colors in the temple veil (red, white, blue, purple); 4 type of soil in parable of Christ, representing the hearts of all people in the world (Matt 13:3-9); Number for judgment/slaughter/destruction/end of probation/ fall of a kingdom (Ezek 14:19-21; Jeremiah 15:1-4; Amos 1:1-9; 2:6-8; Dan 5:25; Rev 9:12); kingdoms come to a conclusion, the number 4 is prevalent: Medo-Persia is noted for four last kings though over 12+ reigned from Cyrus (Daniel 11:1, 2); Greece divided by four primary generals of Alexander though he had far many more; Ottoman Empire divided by 4 primary powers of Europe (Revelation 9:14, 15); 4 winds of strife will be released to bring down Modern Babylon (Revelation 7:1-3).
2. Number signifying the final generation before a close of probation and the brining on of destruction/judgment: Noah preached for three generations (120yrs) and in the 4th generation the floods arrived; Joel spoke of the destruction of Judah by locusts (Babylonians) to 4 generations and then they arrived to pillage the land (Joel 1:1-5); Adventism is in its 4th generation while the leaves of spring begin to bud (Luke 21:29-33). [see Budding Leaves of Spring]
|||Number #6||Number beneath perfection - Number of Satan (SATAN [Teitan] in Greek Numerals = 666)
|||Number #7||Number of Godly Completeness/Perfection; Rest & Restoration: 7-days of week; Noah in ark 7-days before flood; 7-days Jericho was circled; 7 churches of Revelation; 7 seals; 7 plagues; Enoch was 7th generation from Creation; David was 7th born of Jesse; Solomon took 7 years to build the temple in Jerusalem (Gen 2:1-3; Rev 5:6); 7 churches in the Revelation depicting seven eras of church history
|||Numbers #7 and #10||Two numbers that symbolize God's perfection and completeness as seen in the 7 days of the week of Creation and the 10 commandments. The Day of Atonement, a day of reconciliation and judgment, where all records of mens' sins were completely blotted-out as they humbly besought the mercies of God, occurred on the 10th day of the 7th month of the Jewish calendar (Leviticus 16, 23:27-32). This number combination that has divine significance, is parroted by the enemy of God through the workings of the mediums of Pagan and Papal Rome as seen in the following:
  - Three of the ten horns on the head of the beast symbolizing Pagan Rome in Daniel 7 are uprooted by the rise of the Little Horn, leaving seven [see Daily (the), Little Horn]
  - The dragon of Revelation 12:3, 4 representing Satan working through the medium of Pagan Rome, has seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns
  - The leopard like beast of Revelation 13:1-4 representing the Papacy has seven heads, ten horns and ten crowns
|||Number #8||Number above Perfection - Number of God (JESUS [Ie'sous] in Greek Numerals = 888)
|||Number #10||1. Number of Godly Completeness: 10 Commandments (Exodus 20:1-17); 10 plagues of Egypt; 10 Virgins; 10 lepers Jesus healed; Noah was 10th generation from Creation
2. Number of confederacy [of the entire world] under one head (Zechariah 8:23), typically for the enemies of God against Him and His people - Number of the Dragon Power that persecutes at the end of time: 10 Nations in crafty league against Israel (Psalm 83:1-10); Ishmael and 10 men confederate to kill the remnant of Judah after the Babylonians captivity (Jeremiah 40:13-41:3); Haman's 10 sons are hanged with him as they conspired to kill the Jews (Esther 9:10-14); 10 cities of Nimrod, having one language and mind were united with Babel as a one world government, constructing a tower of Babel (Genesis 10:8-12; 11:1-6); 10 women, brought together, baking bread from one oven (Leviticus 26:26); Gideon and 10 men overthrew the alters of Baal at night (Judges 6:27); 10 horns of Pagan Rome in Daniel 7; Ahab, ruling over Samaria [comprised of 10 tribes], warred against the true prophets and people of God (1 Kings 11:29-32; 16:29); Church of Smyrna in Revelation under persecution by Pagan Rome (Diocletian) for 10years/days - 10 different persecutions of the church under Rome; 10 kings at the end of time, having one mind and under the harlot church, lend their power to aid her (Revelation 17:12-17; Daniel 2:41-44). [see Confederate/Confederacy, Dragon4]
3. Number of Testing/Probation; Daniel and the three Hebrew boys were tested for 10 days on the God proscribed diet (Daniel 1:12); 10 virgins are tested to see who will have oil at the time of trial (Matthew 25:13); Nabal died 10 days after his heart was turned to stone (rather than made flesh) in fear (1 Samuel 25:38); The Church of Smyrna was tested for 10 prophetic days (Revelation 2:8-10); the world will be tested and judged upon obedience to the 10 Commandments (Exodus 20:1-17)

|||Number #13||Number of rebellion: After 13 years of oppression the 4 Kings of Sodom rebelled against Chadorlaomer; A decree, deceptively influenced by Haman, was written on the 13th day of the month and issued by the king to kill all the Jews on the 13 th day of the 12th month; Solomon spent 13 years building his own house (Esther 3:12,13; 8:12, 9:1)
|||Number #30||The age in which Joseph stood before Pharaoh, interpreting the dream that the Lord had given and was appointed Prime Minister of Egypt (Genesis 41:39-46). David began to reign as King of Israel and reigned for 40years (2 Samuel 5:4). The price of blood - the number of pieces of silver that Jesus was sold for by Judas Iscariot to the Jewish priests (Matthew 26:14, 15, 27:3-6; Zechariah 11:12, 13). The age at which a Levite would be permitted to serve as priest and minister in the earthly sanctuary (Numbers 4:1-3). The age in which Jesus was baptized in the Jordan and began His earthly ministry (Luke 31:21-23).
|||Number #38||A "rising up". See Deuteronomy 2:13-25; John 5:1-8

Horeb (Sinai) when fleeing Jezebel
|||Number #46||Number of God's covenant and His temple; number of God entering into covenant with a people, and raising the temple of God. Moses was called up to the mount, remained for 6-days and was called into the cloud on the 7th day and remained for 40 days where He received the tables of the covenant - a total of 46 days (Exodus 24:16-18); While on the mount with God, Moses received instructions for building a sanctuary unto the LORD (Exodus 25:8); The two tables of the covenant, the first table has four commandments the second has six commandments; Number of years separating the Scattering of Northern & Southern kingdoms of Ancient Israel (723BC and 677BC); Number Years to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem (John 2:20); Number of days from the resurrection to the Holy Spirit falling at Pentecost - God entering into covenant with the early Church (first fulfillment of prophecies of Joel); Number of Years dividing the First from the Last End of the Indignation; building up of the denominated church (1798-1844); Noah was in the ark 6 days, it rained on the 7th day and continued for 40-days - God entered into covenant with Noah; Every person has 46 chromosomes, signifying the temple of God (1 Corinthians 6:19) [see Written on Tables and Noted in a Book]
|||Number #50||Age at which the Levites could no longer serve in ministering in the tabernacle of the Lord (Numbers 4:1-3)
|||Number #70||Number signifies leadership. Moses selected 70 chosen men as elders among Israel (Exodus 24:1).

Noah preached 120yrs before being saved in the ark, symbolizing the living who will not see death but will be translated to heaven. Moses died at 120yrs old but was resurrected in the special resurrection, symbolizing those who too will be resurrected in the special resurrection before Christ's Second Coming. 120 priests in the time of the building of the temple stood in white garments and sounded the trumpet as one, which brought the glory of the Lord to His temple (2 Chronicles 5:12-14). The watchmen, who stand in the Old Paths, will see eye-to-eye as they sound their trumpets (Jeremiah 6:16, 17)
|||Number #220||Number signifying restoration. The difference in years between the scattering of the southern kingdom (677B.C.) and the issuing of the third decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem (457B.C.) was 220years. The Day of Atonement numerically occurs on the 220th day of the Jewish calendar year (7th month, 10th day - 7 x 30 + 10=220). The number of Nethinims who returned to Jerusalem from Babylon with Ezra (Ezra 8:20).
|||Number #490||Number signifying probation and reconciliation; number of years from the first Passover held in Egypt to appointing of Saul as King of Israel [40yrs in wilderness + 450yrs of Judges] (Acts 13:18-20). Israel was being judged while under a Theocracy (church); number of years from King Saul to the final destruction (3 rd invasion) of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar of the Chaldeans, commencing a 70-year period of punishment for the Nation of Israel. Israel was being judged while under a Monarchy (state); number of years pronounced upon the Nation of Israel to remain God's chosen, covenant people depending upon their obedience (457BC-34AD) and acceptance of the Messiah (Daniel 9:24).
|||Number #1260||Number signifying a treading down, after a period of probation and mercy; number of literal days that Christ ministered to His people on earth, giving warning of a soon close of probation and was then crucified (3.5yrs = 1260days). Period of prophetic days (literal years) given by the term "a time, a times and a dividing of time", or "forty-two months", when the Little Horn or Abomination of Desolation would tread down [rule supreme over] the people of God (Daniel 7:25). A prior 1,260-year period precedes this period, marking the first time of the Gentiles, when the Assyrians scattered Israel (677BC-538AD). Prophetically, the period of years known as the "wilderness of the people" that the church would go into the wilderness where the Lord has prepared a place of refuge from the Dragon (Little Horn). Ezekiel 20:34-37; Revelation 11:2, 12:6. [see Abomination of Desolation, Wilderness; Times of the Gentiles; Measure the Temple of God]
|||Number #1813||Number of years Christ ministered in the first apartment of the heavenly sanctuary, sitting at the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens. When Michael stands up as King of Kings and Lord of Lords, no longer as High Priest, He does so to rule amid His enemies (Psalm 110:1, 2)
|||Number #2300||2300 days of years (literal 2,300 years) that comprised the vision of Daniel 8:1-13, including the reign of the daily, and the reign of the transgression of Desolation, concluding with the cleansing of the sanctuary (Daniel 8:14). The prophetic timeline given to Daniel denoting the chazown vision and culminating with the commencement of the mar'eh vision, where Jesus is brought before the Father and the host of angels on the anti-typical Day of Atonement. The culmination of the 2,300 days are repeated prophetically (line-upon-line) in Daniel 7:9, 10, 13, 14; Malachi 3:1-3; Matthew 25:31-46; and Revelation 3:7, 14:7. [see the Daily, Day of Atonement (antitypical), Vision (chazown: Hebrew) , Vision (mar'eh: Hebrew)]
|||Number #2,520 [scattering]||Number calculated by the term "seven times" (7 x "a time" = 7x360), used as a sign or symbol [as in the Sabbath being a sign or symbol of rest in God (Leviticus 25:1-4; Ezekiel 20:12)] to indicate two distinct themes, a scattering and a gathering. Prophecy, spoken by Moses in Leviticus 26 for the desolation of Israel, starting with the captivity of the Northern Kingdom (Samaria) in 723BC and concluding 2,520 years later in 1798AD (2 Kings 17:1-41; Nehemiah 1:7-9; Daniel 12:7) and the Southern Kingdom (Judah) in 677BC and concluding 2,520 years later in 1844AD (2 Chronicles 33: 9-11 and 2 Kings 21:1-16). A time of judgment and "scattering" due to apostasy and breaking of God's covenant. The 2520 prophecy indicating a scattering is in essence God's letter of divorcement to ancient Israel for their harlotries in breaking the covenant to be God's bride and His peculiar people (Exodus 19:4-8; Isaiah 54:5; Matt 5:31, 32, 19:3-9; Ezekiel 16:8, 25, 30-33, 59;) The scattering of Belshazzar's kingdom in Daniel 5 and the captivity of the Northern Kingdom (Samaria) is an illustration of the scattering, where the kingdoms fell under divine punishment, never to be re-established again. Josiah, as he was rebuilding the temple and discovered the book of the law, understood the covenant curses outlined in the 2,520 prophecies (Jeremiah 50:17, 18; Hosea 5:3-5). The 70th week of the 490year or 70-Week prophecy for the Nation of Israel recorded in Daniel 9:24-27 totals 2520days from the commencement of Christ's ministry in the Fall 27AD to the close of probation for the Nation of Israel in the Fall 34AD. John the Baptist prophetically forewarned the people of Israel of their impending close of probation as he spoke of an axe being laid to the root of the tree of Israel (Luke 3:1-9). Nimrod's kingdom was scattered (Genesis 11:8), foreshadowing the scattering of Nebuchadnezzar for seven times or 2520 days, as well as the scattering of Belshazzar's kingdom as given by the handwriting on the wall, totaling 2520.
|||Number #2,520 [gathering]||number calculated by the term "seven times" (7 x "a time" = 7x360), used as a sign or symbol [as in the Sabbath being a sign or symbol of rest in God (Leviticus 25:1-4; Ezekiel 20:12)] to indicate two distinct themes, a scattering and a gathering. Prophecy, spoken by Moses in Leviticus 26 for the desolation of Israel, starting with the captivity of the Northern Kingdom (Samaria) in 723BC and concluding 2,520 years later in 1798AD (2 Kings 17:1-19; Nehemiah 1:7-9; Daniel 12:7) and the Southern Kingdom (Judah) in 677BC and concluding 2,520 years later in 1844AD (2 Chronicles 33: 9-11 and 2 Kings 21:1-16). A time of gathering and re-establishment of a covenant after a period of judgment, all based on the condition of repentance, contrition, and acceptance of punishment by God's mercy (Isaiah 2; Micah 4:1-3; Jeremiah 31:10, 11-20, 28). The experience of Nebuchadnezzar and Judah, the Southern Kingdom are experiences of a gathering where divine mercy reinstated both kingdoms after a period of punishment. Elijah prayed seven times for the rains to return to the land after 3.5yrs of famine (1Kings 18:41-44). The gathering of God's people is seen in those who followed Christ into the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary, at the conclusion of the Last Indignation (October 22, 1844) when God vow to re-establish His covenant with a people and blot out their sins (in the Most Holy Place) permanently. This final time of gathering will be marked by all gathering under the ensign of Christ, His righteousness, and His 7th day Sabbath commandment the seal of the true God of Creation and Redemption. (Isaiah 11:10-13; 30:26) [see Gather; Scatter; Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsen; Ma-her-shal'-al-hash'-baz; She-ar-jash'-ub; Indignation (the Lord's),Ensign]
|||Number #144,000||Number of God's end time people, redeemed from a Laodicean stupor (Isaiah 55:6, 7, 12, 13; Isaiah 41:21-23; James 1:1), bearing the seal of God, the Father's name/character on their forehead (Rev 7:1-8l 14:1-5), and who God lifts up, as the Wave Offerings, as an ensign to the rest of the world to draw them to the God of heaven (Isaiah 5:26; 11:12-14; 55:5; Zech 9:16). They have eaten the book (sure word of prophecy in Daniel), been purged of leaven (received the Former Rain), come and drank of the waters (received the Latter Rain), are clothed in Christ's Righteousness, are glorified (sins are blotted out - Psalm 32:1-11; Rev 14:5; Jude 1:24) and are the first fruits of the bountiful redemption (Isaiah 55:1-5). The Latter Rain message which revives the sleeping, dead dry bones of Laodicea (Jacob) and brings forth seed for these end-time Sowers (Israel - see Isaiah 27:6) will be given with might from the Lord and will not return unto Him void (Isaiah 55:5-11). Their message to the world is the Third Angel's message of Revelation 14, announcing the close of God's celestial judgment. They sing a song based on their experiences in the last days that no one else can sing but themselves (Rev 14:3). [see Firstfruit, Lamp, Daughter of Zion, Wave Loaves; Elijah (Elias); Rebuilding the Alter of the Lord]
|||Oil (for lamps)||The Holy Spirit (Exodus 35:14; Leviticus 24:2; Matthew 25:1-13; John 16:13-15; 2 Peter 1:19-21; Proverbs 22:19-21; 2 Timothy 3:16, 17). [see Wise (the)]
|||Oil (myrrh)||Used for purification, one of the gifts brought to King Jesus by wise men [students of prophecy who receive the Early & Latter Rain who receive dreams and visions (Joel 2:28, 29)] who also bear His Righteousness [frankincense] and White Raiment [gold - Rev 3:18] (Matt 2:1-3, 11, 12). The three gifts we are to bring are Christ's 3 Angel's messages that command us to worship Him.
|||Old Bottles/Garments||teachings, doctrines, attitudes and behavior based on man's teachings and misinterpretations of God's laws and statutes. The old bottles could not bear the pure, uncontaminated pure wine from the True Vine (Jesus Christ) nor could the old garments withstand the new cloth offered by Christ's cloak of righteousness (Matthew 9:16, 17). [see ? Wine (New)/Cloth (New), Garments (whitened)/Cloth (New)]
|||One's forehead||The human mind or thought; frontal lobe of the brain where thinking, reasoning, and decisions are processed; to believe with one's conscience. God instructed that His laws and commands be written both on our hands and foreheads. (Rev 7:3, 13:16, Ezek 9:4, Philip 2:5, Deuteronomy 6:6-8, 11:13-20). [see One's hand]
|||One's hand||One's actions, deeds or works; to endorse "politically", not by conscience but by 'necessity', force, or fear (Rev 9:20, 13:16). God instructed that His laws and commands be written both on our hands and foreheads (Deuteronomy 6:6-8; 11:13-20). [see One's forehead]
|||Overcome||The experience of Jesus Christ and of the righteous who are victorious through Christ. Jesus overcame sin, death, and the grave and became the Author of Salvation for all who would also overcome through His atoning blood. Jesus' victory was marked by a consistent reliance and complete faith upon His Father (Psalm 16:8), self-denial, and a thorough knowledge of scripture and the prophetic word made plain by the Holy Spirit. So too, those of every generation must find victory in Christ through the same. Those throughout the prophetic era of church history who will inherit the kingdom of God are consistently noted as they who overcome until the end (until death or Christ's coming) and are said to inherit the following:
  1. A right to the Tree of Life in the paradise of God (Revelation 2:1-7) [see Ephesus]
  2. A crown of life and they will not be hurt by the Second Death (Revelation 2:8-11) [see Smyrna]
  3. A right to eat of the hidden manna and a white stone with a name written that only the recipient will know (Revelation 2:12-17) [see Pergamos]
  4. A rod of iron to rule over the nations just as Jesus was given the same, and the morning star, Jesus Christ Himself and His truths (Revelation 2:18-29, 12:5; 2 Peter 1:19) [see Thyatira, Iron]
  5. White raiment and his name will not be blotted out of the Book of Life and Jesus will confess his name before the Father and the angels (Revelation 3:1-6) [see Sardis, White Robes (Raiment)]
  6. Will be made a pillar in the temple of God, never to depart from His presence again. They will have the Father's name, Christ's new name and New Jerusalem written upon them (Revelation 3:7-12 [see Philadelphia]
  7. Will sit on Christ's throne with Him just as Christ was granted to sit on the Father's throne(Revelation 3:13-22, 20:4-6) [ see Laodicea]
|||Overflow||Army invasion, a besiegement (Jeremiah 47:2-4; Daniel 11:10, 26, 40) [see Waters]
|||Overthrown||The fate of those who willfully or carelessly neglect God's words of counsel and spurn God's love. Refusing to keep His commandments, they suffer the following: being shaken out, shunned of God so He does not hear their plea (prayers), their crowns are taken from them (Revelation 3:11), their sins are not blotted-out of God's book of record, and God's wrath will be kindled against them (Job 19:6-11; Jeremiah 11:14, 18:23; Psalm 141:6; Matthew 13:5, 6, 20, 21; Daniel 11:41). These are they who shun godly counsel and fail to develop a love for truth and are therefore lulled into a deceptive spirit of security, believing the lies of the enemy through false prophets; in their minds they make a covenant with death and the grave such that they feel they will be spared from God's wrath in the day of judgment. However, God assures these same one's that their destruction is assured (Isaiah 28:15, 17, 18; Jeremiah 11:21; 14:10-12) [see Shaking, Fall/Fallen/Fallen Away2 , "Spue thee out of My mouth"; Cry Aloud; Mark of the Beast, Closed Door, Shut Door Message, Foolish (the), Tares; Watchmen (Blind); Pull Away the Shoulder/Stopped the Ears/Hearts as an Adamant Stone]
|||Overturn, Overturn, Overturn||An expression used in Ezekiel 21:27 to denote the successive kingdoms to arise and reign over the conquered realm of Judah until Shiloh, Jesus (Genesis 49:10-12), appears, "Whose right it is" to take the Throne of Grace (Hebrews 4:16). Starting with the kingdom of Babylon, the expression is given as follows:
  1. Babylon is overturned by Medo-Persia
  2. Medo-Perisa is overturned by Greece
  3. Greece is overturned by Rome
  4. Shiloh (Jesus) appears

The three overturns also parallel the Three Woes that would befall spiritual Babylon, as well as the destructions foretold in the Three Angel's Messages [see Woes (three)]
|||Paganism/Heathenism||Any worship of false gods or idols based on human dogmas, man's teachings, sensual and carnal lusts, all in opposition to the knowledge and worship of the true God of Creation and the Lord of Redemption. The perversions of true religion are born of demonic origin and often exhibit one or more of the following traits: (2 Samuel 22:44; 2 Kings 16:3; 17:8-17):
  1. The elevation of man as a god and the promotion of self-worship [man's way, man's ideas, man vs. a knowledge of God] as opposed to acknowledging the One Sovereign God of Creation and Redemption who deserves man's worship
  2. Perverse worship that stimulates and feeds men's senses and lower passions (sex, food, amusement) as opposed to worship that ennobles and elevates the mind while promoting self- control through the power made available by an all-powerful God
  3. A belief in man's need to save himself through his own merits, noble works, and acts of contrition in contrast to the grace offered by a loving self-sacrificing God (Matthew 19:16-22; Matthew 11:28-30).
  4. The idea that God is distant and either disinterested in men or seeking to punish men for their wrongs they have committed verses a loving, personal, and merciful God that makes provision for man's benefit while still upholding justice and righteousness
  5. The belief in many gods (polytheism) ruling over different aspects of one's life verses the One, Sovereign, triune God of Creation.

Besides misrepresenting and misinforming its adherents of the true character and nature of the loving God of Creation and Redemption, once ardent followers of these man-made religions at times become frustrated by the inconsistencies, hypocrisy, injustices, and attempts to control minds by those who are in control. In turn, these same followers at times reject God all together and formal religion as false or manipulative to the delight of the enemy of souls. Paganism is the religion of Satan, founded in his works of iniquity once started in heaven that wars against God and His authority. Those who follow after pagan/hedonistic doctrine deny the natural and visible truths of God made known in nature, His counsels given in the Bible, His Word, and the works of God demonstrated through the Son, Jesus Christ (Isaiah 14:12-17; Ezekiel 28:12-18; 2 Thessalonians 2:7-9; Romans 1:18-32; Psalm 19). [see Daily (the); Abomination of Desolation; Spiritualism; ? Righteousness by Faith]
|||Pantheon||The Roman "House of the gods" located in the capital of Rome. The Pantheon housed all the strange gods inherited from the various lands, cultures, and peoples colonized by the Roman armies. Unlike other peoples who in battle declared their gods superior over their rival victims, Rome adopted the gods and deities of their enemies and incorporated them in its pagan capital, housing them within paganism's sanctuary of strength, the Pantheon (Daniel 11:31). In so doing, Rome exalted paganism more than any other prior kingdom, making it popular, common, and universal (catholic) for all people. The Pantheon, being a place acceptable to all gods and styles of worship foreshadows the modern ecumenism that is a tenant of Papal Rome. The Ecumenical Movement is based on Papal Rome's belief that she is the Mother Church of Christianity and vows not to suffer the loss of any children due to Protestantism (Isaiah 47:8). The movement therefore is a subversive means of gaining alliance with Protestantism and its lost allegiances returned to the Roman Pontiff. The Roman Pantheon today stands as the Roman Catholic church of St. Mary and the Martyrs. [see Sanctuary of Strength; Paganism/Heathenism; Daily (the); Queen of Heaven (The)]
|||Pass by||A term used to refer to the gracious and merciful work of God blotting out sin, pardoning transgression, and remembering our iniquities no more. At the Sunday Law, the end of summer, God will no longer pass by the sins of His people, Modern Israel, or the Seventh-day Adventist Church (Micah 8:1, 2; Amos 7:18, 19).
|||Pass under the Rod||A term taken from animal husbandry where animals are closely inspected by their shepherd and separated; signifying separation or sifting, judging, rebuke/chastisement, investigation (before entering into covenant with). (Ezekiel 20:37, 38). [see Investigative Judgment; Purge/Purify]
|||Path of the Just / Paths to Dwell in/ Old Paths||All the counsels and revelations of God given through visions and dreams given to the prophets for which men were to walk to find peace and safety under the shadow of the Almighty. The paths of righteousness that the Lord causes us to walk in to His name's glory through faithful surrender, embracing His Everlasting Covenant, obedience, and repentance of sin. Those living in the last days prophetically referenced in Isaiah 58:12 who will restore the breach caused by error and tradition, and direct people of their time to walk in the "Old Paths", the former truths of God obscured by men's dogmas yet upheld by the prophets and reformers of old. The paths of the just are said to lead its followers to the everlasting Kingdom of God (Proverbs 4:8). These old paths, once ignored and neglected by the people of God, though they were their shield, defense, and what caused them to be distinct, were made to be obscured to them by the Lord because of their rebellion causing them to be scattered, led captive, and laid waste in a barren land (Hosea 2:6-13). However, in mercy the Lord promises to gather His people once again in the Last Days and set them back on the paths of the just (Hosea 2:14-23). The old paths are said to cause a controversy where those who walk in the old paths will suffer affliction from those who refuse the light but choose to walk in darkness (Jeremiah 6:16, 17; 18:15-18; Habakkuk 2:1; Isaiah 27:8; Proverbs 4:18, 19; Hosea 14:1-9; Amos 9:11-15). [see Ways and Old Paths (Walk ye in the); ? Crooked Paths]
|||Peace and Safety||The deceptive message of the false/foolish prophets or blind watchmen given when there is neither peace nor safety (1 Thessalonians 5:3). The message of demonic origin is given to dumb-down, pacify, and lull its hearers into a state of complacency so that the day of the Lord may come upon them unawares, as a thief in the night. Yet, the masses of people are complicit in their desire to hear a peace and safety message which is smooth and easy, requiring no repentance of wrong or reformation (Micah 2:6-11). Jesus, the Prince of Peace, gives His peace based on a spiritual relationship established through the Holy Spirit (John 14:27). The peace that Jesus offers is a gift and fruit of the Spirit that can in no wise be manifested by any earthly or human agency. Christ also promises that the safety He gives is God borne: "He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty" (Psalm 91:1-16). The safety offered by the false prophets may allude to civil protection, military might, arms and strength that may be offered by a government. Therefore, one may reason that the peace and safety message given by false prophets foreshadows and exhibits the spiritual workings of the demonic threefold power that seeks to unify the institutions of church and state in order to control the minds of men. (Jeremiah 28:10-17; Ezekiel 13:1-16; Matthew 7:15, 16; 1 Thessalonians 5:1-11; Amos 9:9, 10; Micah 3:5-7). [see Watchmen (Blind/False); False Prophet (the); Untempered Mortar; Babylon3 ; ? Shut Door Message]
|||Pentecost||Feast celebrating God entering into covenant with His people: Penta, meaning fifty (50), number of days from the Passover until Moses received the Law or two tables of the covenant from God on Mt. Sinai. Fifty days after the death of Christ that the Christian Church received power from the Holy Spirit [Former Rain] to preach the gospel. Offering for Pentecost [former Jewish Feast of Harvest] included two wave loaves of leavened bread, paralleling the two tables given to Moses, but also signifying the people of God who once had leaven (sin) but has had it thoroughly baked out by the Holy Spirit's baptism of fire (Luke 3:16). In the end time (Adventist history), two tables/prophetic charts produced in 1842 and 1850 by the Holy Spirit are a token of the covenant God has entered into with His end time church (Habakkuk 2:2, 3). Knowledge and acceptance of the three parallel histories in the last day will be a sign of God entering into covenant with the 144,000. [See Wave Loaves, Former Rain]
|||Pergamos (Church of)||The 3rd of seven prophetic churches described in the Revelation, denoting an era of the Christian Church history. (Revelation 2:12-17). Meaning "height or elevation", this church held fast the name and faith of Jesus Christ and was also persecuted under the Pagan Roman Empire. Like Smyrna, heresies (literal/spiritual fornication, foods offered to idols) had steadily crept into the church by false prophets and "subversive converts" (Balaam) who sought to put a stumbling block before the faith of the believers. Jesus admonishes those who under such influences have fallen to repent lest they fall under condemnation by the Word of God [Sword in the mouth of Jesus]. This is the church that witnessed the transition from the daily to the transgression of desolation. (Revelation 2:12-17). [see Smyrna, Thyatira]
|||Pharaoh||In ancient times, the earthly representation of the sun god - the one who casts his shadow over Egypt (Isaiah 30:2, 3). Aptly called the great dragon (Ezekiel 29:2, 3), Pharaoh in the time of the Hebrew Exodus held the people of God in a "death grip", refusing to release them from their bondage. After God had demonstrated His power over heaven and earth to this defiant human subject, even inflicting painful punishment upon him and his people, he still refused to relent. Pharaoh would be driven to his death and the death of his people before he would make any sincere attempt at humbling himself of his pride before the God of Heaven, a fitting depiction of Satan or the Devil (Ezekiel 28:17, 18; Isaiah 14:12-17). The Papacy, the man of sin, the son of perdition, and the modern spiritual Prophetic Symbols: Interpreting Bible Prophecy representation of the sun god, assumes the same defiant position as Pharaoh of old, forcing all to worship the sun (Sunday) on threat of death (2 Thessalonians 2:3,4; Ezekiel 28:1-10). That which particularly vexed Pharaoh of old, namely, the Children of Israel resting upon, and honoring God's 7th day Sabbath (Exodus 4:29- 5:19) will be that which vexes or "troubles" the spiritual pharaoh during the end times (Daniel 11:41-45). The great dragon, like the whore Babylon (or Pharaoh) will meet its destruction at the hands of the Lord and will be scattered for all to behold (Ezekiel 30:2-5; 32:2-15)[see Image to the Beast; Dragon; Babylon (Mystery)]
|||Pharisees||Meaning "separated"
|||Philadelphia (Church of)||The 6th of seven prophetic churches described in the Revelation, denoting an era of the Christian Church history. Philadelphia is the exalted church raised up at the beginning of the Time of the End (1798AD) and commanded to prophecy again (Revelation 10:11; 11) following a period of intense trial [Great Disappointment of 1844AD]. It is to this church that biblical knowledge increases (Daniel 12:4) and God reveals His last day truths, commencing the Advent movement. It is to this church that Christ reveals the open door to the 2nd apartment of the heavenly sanctuary (Revelation 11:19) that He alone can open and He alone can shut (Rev 3:7, 8). It is this church that God enters into covenant with after the conclusion of the Time of the Gentiles. Lastly, Christ promises to preserve it from the Hour of Temptation that will come upon the earth because of their faithfulness in proclaiming His last day truths, despite the sneers from those of the synagogue of Satan (Revelation 3:7-13). [see Time of the End; Hour of Temptation; Sardis; Laodecia]
|||Pisseth against the Wall||A term that signifies a male person, however, the Bible uses the term exclusively to describe the wicked who piss against the wall, or the Law of God (1 Samuel 25:34; 1 Kings 14:10, 16:11; 2 Kings 9:8). [see Wall (The)]
|||Pleasant Land ||Jerusalem/Palestine to Ancient Israel; a land where the eyes of the Lord were upon year-round; a delightsome land. (Deuteronomy 11:11, 12; Jeremiah 3:18, 19; Psalm 106:21-26; Zech 7:14; Ex 3:7, 8; Ezek 20:5, 6, 15; Hosea 9:13; Malachi 3:11, 12)
|||Power, Seat & Great Authority||Three things that the Dragon power (Satan and/or Pagan Rome) of Revelation 13 yielded to the Leopard-Like Beast (the Papacy) before it assumed control over the world. Power is the military might that was ceded to the Papacy starting in 496AD by Clovis, Emperor of France and joined by the 6 other European Kings in subduing the three Barbarian Tribes for the Papacy. The "Seat" which is the city of Rome, was vacated and ceded in 330AD by Constantine when he moved the seat of his government to Constantinople. The "Authority" is power to reign over all matters of a religious nature and to pronounce any person, even the king a heretic (Bishop of Rome is the "Corrector of Heretics"), as decreed by Emperor Justinian in 533AD. (Revelation 13:2) [see Abomination of Desolation, Daily (the)]
|||Prejudice||Satanic deceptions and delusions playing upon men's inherent pride, that discourages a person from trying/tasting/evaluating a thing so that they may come to know truth
|||Priest, Priesthood||The spiritual leaders appointed by men to serve as the intercessors, teachers, and guides for the people. The priests were to live holy lives before God as they stood in the gap, representing the people and their petitions to the Lord. The priesthood was a holy office that required strict conformity to health, moral, and ceremonial statutes ordained by God. The office of priest in the Jewish Nation was to symbolize by example, the sanctity that each person should pursue in their lives. Christ today stands as High Priest, Pries among priests, where He daily makes intercession for the sins of His people. The body of believers that make up the Christian Church, are to be a royal priesthood to God in administering the needs of the people and standing in the gap for those who will come to know the true God of heaven and earth.
|||Prince||1. A ruler; one who reigns. (Genesis 17:20, 25:16; Numbers 1:16; Daniel 10:20, 21, 12:1; Matthew 20:25; John 12:31, 14:30, 16:11; Acts 5:31; Ephesians 2:2, 6:12; 1 Corinthians 2:8)
2. The heir and direct descendent of a king. (Ezekiel 28:2, 12)
|||Prince of Peace||A title of Jesus - Prince of Salem. God identifies Himself as the Lord of Peace and His earthly sanctuary, constructed by Solomon whose name and kingdom was marked by peace and quietness, was made for the habitation of all nations to dwell (1 Chronicles 22:9; Psalm 76:1, 2; Isaiah 2:1-4, 56:7; Matthew 21:12, 13). God is typified through the earthly figure Melchisedec, whose name means the King of Righteousness and King of Salem (peace) and whose beginnings and end are unfounded (Hebrews 7:1-5). God is the One who seeks to make peace by His own blood with the Briars and Thorns [the wicked] lest they be consumed, bearing the curse of the Law (Isaiah 9:6, 27:4-6; Malachi 4:6; Romans 5:1; Colossians 1:12-20). [see Briars and Thorns]
|||Prince of princes||A title of Jesus, the Eternal God; He is the Ruler of rulers, or "King of Kings and Lord of Lords" (Daniel 8:25, 11, 10:21; 12:1; Acts 4:24-28; Revelation 19:16)
|||Prison||Being in bondage or a slave to Satan and sin (Exodus 20:1; Isaiah 42:6, 7; 1 Peter 3:18-20; Romans 6:16-22). [see Egypt (Land of)]
|||Prisoners of Hope||Those who have died in the faith of Jesus Christ and await their redemption at the Second Coming of Christ; those who will partake of the First Resurrection, upon whom the Second Death has no power. Jesus pronounces a blessing for all who die in the faith because they rest from the toils of life and their [good] works do follow them (Psalm 116:15; Zechariah 9:11, 12; John 5:28, 29; 1 Thessalonians 4:15-18; Revelation 14:13, 20:6).
|||Proof Texting||The God-centered method of Bible exposition, interpretation, and translation that is wholly reliant upon the Holy Spirit's revelation of the truths of God (John 16:13). The method requires that the Bible be its own interpreter and therefore affirms all doctrine and teachings upon the testimony of two or more witnesses (Deuteronomy 19:15, John 8:17, 2 Corinthians 13:1). The method requires the user to rely upon the following Bible Principles:
  - Complete faith in God and His Word: 2 Timothy 3:16, 17, Psalm 33:11, Isaiah 8:20 Faith and reliance upon the Holy Spirit to bring revelation: John 16:13, Hebrews 11:6, 1 Corinthians 2:13-16, Deuteronomy 29:29 
  - The superiority of God's wisdom and His Words [Scripture] over all others: 1 Corinthians 1:18-25, Colossians 2:6-9, Isaiah 29:13, 14 The Lord prospered the early Advent Movement in North America under William Miller by the use of this Bible study method while Protestant churches of the time focused on Historical Critical Interpretation of Scriptures. God has placed His endorsement upon the Proof-Texting method and has promised to bless all who follow in its path (Acts 20:32; 2 Timothy 2:15; Romans 10:17). [see Path of the Just / Paths to Dwell in/ Old Paths ? Hermeneutics]
|||Prophet||1. A spiritual leader appointed by God to be His spokesperson to the people of God. In times of questioning when answers from the Lord were to be sought, the leadership and priests of the land were to seek the counsel of the prophet, sit at his or her feet and hear a message from the Lord (Ezekiel 20:1-3). The role of the prophet, like the priesthood, was a holy office that required strict conformity to health, moral and ceremonial statutes ordained by God. The prophet's life, words, and experiences were to convey God's counsels and sentiments towards His people. Most commonly, the prophet was often tasked with conveying words of correction and reproof to the people for their waywardness. Therefore, the life of the prophet was often very difficult. Christ fulfilled His work as Prophet of God during his 3.5yrs of ministry on earth.
2. A spiritual leader who receives teachings, unction, and a message from the Lord to edify the church of God. The second form of prophet need not receive visions and dreams, yet their message is consistent with the word of God and a restatement of the messages of the prophets of old. Prophets of this type are also known as "sons of the prophets" or a modern "Bible worker" (1 Kings 18:13; 2 Kings 4:38; 1 Corinthians 14:3, 4, 29-33)
|||Protestantism||The freedom to exercise a personal relationship with Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord of one's life; To "protest" the abuses, false doctrines, dogmas, and usurpation of authority belonging to God alone by Popery. A movement raised-up by God to reinstate true Christian, biblical doctrine, long obscured by the traditions, superstitions, and pagan teachings of Rome. The tenets of the Protestant Reformers and the Reformation Movement, spoken in the language of Rome [Latin] as a rebuke to its own teachings, were founded upon the following principles:
  - Sola Scriptura: scripture alone shall be man's guide to correct, instruct, reprove, and teach doctrine (Hebrew 4:12; 2 Timothy 3:14-17; 2 Peter 1:1-21)
  - Sola Cristus: Christ alone is man's only source for forgiveness, reconciliation, and salvation; Christ alone deserves our praise and is our example of godliness (1 Timothy 2:5; Matthew 23:9-12; Luke 22:24-27; Mark 10:42-44; John 13:1-17)
  - Sola Gratia: by grace alone is one saved and not be works (sacraments or ordinances), lest one should boast; it is the gift of God (Ephesians 2:8, 9; Titus 3:7)
  - Sola Fide: by faith in the finished works of God will we overcome the world (Galatians 2:16, 3:11; 1 John 5:4)
  - Soli Deo Gloria: to God alone be the glory (Revelation 4:11; 15:3, 4; Matthew 23:9)

The movement is allegorically prophesied through the story of Jeroboam, who was raised up due to the rebellions of the house of David (1 Kings 11:37-39, 12:26-29; Revelation 2:20, 21). All the covenant blessings and curses offered to the house of David were extended to Jeroboam who was given kingship over 10 tribes of Israel, yet Jeroboam lacked faith in God and built two counterfeit temples with two golden calves for worship, fearing the people would return to the house of David. Similarly, Protestantism, lacking faith that God would keep them, give them a "sure house [foundation]" and lead them into all truth, settled for the two counterfeit relics of Popery in Sunday sacredness (1 Kings 11:38, 12:32; Matthew 7:24-27) and Spiritualism (the immortality of the soul). When Protestantism shall forsake its founding tenets and join hands with the Papacy in creating an Image to the Beast, then Protestantism will have fulfilled the workings of the prophetic False Prophet. [see Spiritualism; Transgression of Desolation; Image to the Beast; False Prophet (the); Jeroboam, son of Nebat] Pull Away the Shoulder/Stopped the Ears/Hearts as an Adamant Stone = the response of the wicked to the true counsels of God. Those who refuse the good and choose the evil to their own hurt are they whose hearts are made as an adamant stone towards the Lord and His prophets (Isaiah 7:15, 16; Zechariah 7:11-14). Thus, the Lord scattered them and will ultimately destroy those who turn not from their ways to purse the fruit of righteousness. [see Overthrown]
|||Purge/Purify||The work of God through the Holy Spirit, brought about by the rains, first in measure and then without measure [Early & Latter Rains]. The work of God to remove the sins of the people, blot out their transgressions from His book of record and dawn upon them His garments of righteousness. The work of Purging and Purification is preceded by a change in heart for those desiring to be made pure, causing them to return to the ways and counsels of God of the past. This brings forth fruit of righteousness, a change in character, prompting men to forsake their past sinful ways, caste down their alters beating them into chalkstone; remove the high places of their hearts and forsaking the groves where they once worshipped false gods and idols (Isaiah 27:6, 8, 9; Malachi 3:2-4; 2 Thessalonians 1:3-5). [see Fire (God's); Early (Former) Rain; Latter Rain; Righteousness; Sons of Levi; Heart (The); High Places, Groves, Alters]
|||Purple||Royalty, grandeur (Exodus 26:1; Proverbs 31:22; Song of Solomon 7:5; Mark 15:17, 18; John 19:2, 3; Rev 17:4)
|||Push (against)||To war against; gore, push [down, -ing] (Daniel 8:4)
|||Quarrel of God's Covenant||The curses of God poured out upon the rebellious who through scornful neglect have broken His covenant (Leviticus 26:25)
|||Queen of Heaven (The)||The goddess Queen of Babylon (Semiramis) that is known as the god of forces (often depicted as an armed woman with armor) and mother of Horus or Tammuz. This pagan goddess became a favored idol for the Israelites in great offense to God [a contemporary Hebrew calendar month is called Tammuz]. Today, the church of Rome has taken the pagan worship of the Queen of Heaven and applied it to Mary, the mother of Jesus and likened Tammuz to Jesus, who also in mythology dies and is resurrected with each summer and winter solstice respectively (sun worship). The U.S. Statue of Liberty, given by France to this nation at a time when Christianity was shunned and atheism, humanism, and men's reason extolled in France, glorifies the Queen of Heaven. (Jeremiah 44:16-21; Ezekiel 8:13, 14; Daniel 11:38). [see Pantheon; Babylon (Mystery)]
|||Quick/Quicken||Life; to give life. The word of God is quick and powerful (life/life giving), sharper than a two-edged sword... (Hebrews 4:12)
|||Rabbah||Meaning "the Great City", was the last city to be conquered by David in his occupation of the Promised Land. This Great City is prophetically paralleled to Babylon, the Great City that would be a stable for the camels of the Ammonites, a prophetic reference to Islam, and would eventually be laid waste and barren (2 Samuel 12:26; Ezekiel 25:4, 5; Judges 7:12; Jeremiah 49:2). [see Great City; Golden City]
|||Rahab||Meaning insolence or pride, the name ascribed to the land of Egypt that demonstrated pride against God (Psalm 87:4; 89:10; Isaiah 51:9). [see Egypt (Land of)]
|||Rainbow||Sign of a covenant between God and the earth (Gen 9:9-17); God of the Covenant (Rev 4:2-3; 10:1); the glory of the Lord (Revelation 10:1). The rainbow comes with the rain, therefore, He whose glory is the rainbow also brings the rains, the early and latter (Ezek 1:28). [see Early (Former) Rain, Latter Rain]
|||Razor for hire||The Assyrians that the Lord would raise up to shave the feet, head, and beards of His people Samaria because of their rebellion (Isaiah 7:17-20) [see Hireling, Bee of Assyria]
|||Rebuilding the Alter of the Lord||The work of reformation and revival that the Lord brought about in the hearts of those who purposed to follow the Lord. Too often, the alter of the Lord was forsaken, fell into disrepair, and ignored in favor of the sensual, self-seeking worship of strange and foreign gods by God's chosen people. God, in mercy, raised-up sincere, reform minded individuals whose works and counsels included:
  1. Reminding and calling for men to acknowledge and worship the true God
  2. A need for repentance and seeking forgiveness of sin
  3. A return to the old paths: all the commandments, statutes, and precepts of God
  4. A forsaking of sin and false worship
  5. A gathering of the people in unity to perform the work of the Lord, who promises to be with His people (Haggai 1:12, 13)
  6. A purposeful and daily walk with God
  7. Restoration and return to the purposes of those called and chosen, to proclaim the good news of a loving God to the world

Each of the prophets of God were commissioned to perform this sacred work and we no less are called
to do the same today (Isaiah 58:12-14). [see Elijah (Elias); Number #144,000; ? Tares]
|||Reform Movements||Throughout the Bible the Lord has given examples of Reform Movements and Reformers who typify the last great reform movement that will gather in the Lord's harvest before His Second Coming (Matthew 9:36-38; Revelation 14:13-16). The Reform Movements throughout history, all of which were out-workings of God's Holy Spirit, all have common characteristics that establish a God ordained pattern for which future movements must employ:
  1. Preceded by an era of Spiritual Darkness and Apostasy
  2. An increase of knowledge and revelation of God's Law or of hidden biblical truths is made by searching the scriptures (eating the book - Ezekiel 2:8, 9)
  3. A recognition and conviction of sin and judgment due to apostasy and waywardness takes hold
  4. Humble repentance and turning to God
  5. A call to gather in the people of God that have been scattered prior to and during the era of spiritual darkness (call is often not heeded by all) [see Overthrown]
  6. Entering into covenant with God and recommitment to serving Him faithfully (turning the heart unto God)
  7. Removal of idols, foreign gods and all things that served as a stumbling block to the faith (Ezra 9:5-10:5)
  8. Restoration of true worship; Restorers of the Breach (Isaiah 58:11, 12)

Fulfillment of this prophetic pattern is seen in the Holy Spirit's working through the lives and works of the following Reformers in their eras: Elijah (1 Kings 17-19); Hezekiah (2 Kings 18); Josiah (2 Kings 22, 23); Ezra/Nehemiah; John the Baptist (Malachi 4:4-6; Luke 1, 3:1-23); Martin Luther (1505-1546AD); William Miller (1798-1844AD); You and Me (Today). [see Rebuilding the Alter of the Lord; Elijah (Elias); Three Angels' Message; Remnant; Eating the Little Book]
|||Refreshing||The result of repenting of one's sin, being converted so that our sins are blotted out and receiving of Jesus Christ that yields rest (Exodus 31: ; Acts 3:19-21); brought about by a message, the Latter Rain, that is conveyed line upon line by a people with a different tongue and stammering lips (Isaiah 28:11, 12).
|||Rejoicing City (the)||A prophetic symbol of Ninevah, the capital city of Assyria that foreshadows Babylon the Great, who in her revelry declares she will never suffer loss. This rejoicing city is full of stirs [laughter, mirth, and music] as it in rebellion and apostasy worships sun, moon and starts, a tribute to Satan. The boast of the city is that "I am, and there is none besides me" (Zephaniah 2:13-15; Isaiah 47:8). When the people of God are likened to the Rejoicing City that is full of stirs, it shows that they are in a state of apostasy and soon to be overthrown, lest reformation and revival arise (Revelation 18:1-8; Exodus 32:15-19; Isaiah 22:1-4). [see Babylon (Mystery); Bloody City (The); City (Joyous & Tumultuous)]
|||Remnant||The few, faithful worshipers of God in every age that embrace God's everlasting covenant and stand-out as an ensign to the rest of the world; those who remain or are called after a period of scattering. The end-time people of God are a reproach to the rest of the world and are a nation not desired of men that the Lord Himself will gather in after being scattered [in doctrine, teachings and purpose] (Isaiah 66:5; Zephaniah 2:1-3). They bear the characteristics of the original church of Eden and the Apostolic Church:
  - They worship the one true God of Creation. Like the Sons of Levi, they refuse to worship the image but remain loyal to God even unto death, and therefore become God's royal priesthood (Acts 4:24; Daniel 3:12-30; Revelation 14:7, 13:15; 1 Peter 2:5, 9; Revelation 20:4-6)
  - They purpose in their hearts to faithfully keep all the commandments, statutes, and precepts of God, including the 4th commandment, the Seal of God. Because they have made a practice of purposing to follow God and affirming their commitment continually; following the example of Christ, they stand immoveable and unshakable through the power of Christ during their time of trial and they love not their lives unto the death (Revelation 12:11, 17, 14:7; Exodus 20:8-11; Daniel 3:16-18, 28; Matthew 26:39, 42)
  - They are tried through fires [trials] of purification without being consumed because the Lord is with them to keep them. The fires of purification burn off the dross in their characters so that they may receive white raiment to wear and can stand faultless before the Holy God. They are overcomers through Christ, who then causes them to stand as an ensign to the rest of the world (Daniel 3:16-30, 12:10; Isaiah 43:1-3, 64:4; Malachi 3:2-4; Jude 1:24; 2 Peter 1:1-4; Titus 2:11, 12)
  - They honor God even in their diet, choosing not to defile themselves with unclean foods (Leviticus 11; Daniel 1:8-21; Isaiah 65:2-5)
  - They give God the glory in all things, rather than taking praise to themselves (Daniel 2:26-30; Revelation 14:7)
  - Their characters are distinguishable among the masses. "These are they who follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth". They stand for righteousness when all others bow in worship to falsehood; they demonstrate the "silence of the Lamb", the meekness of Christ (Matthew 27:12-14, Isaiah 53:7; Philippians 2:5-8); they are a peculiar people, zealous of good works, they often are the only or few who stand for righteousness when all others move with the flood of dissipation, and they overcome through the faith of Jesus Christ by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony (Daniel 3:1-18; Micah 7:1-3, 7-20; Revelation 14:1-5, 12, 12:11; John 17:14; Titus 2:14)
  - They understand, are counseled by, and order their lives per the prophetic gift and are thereforeconsidered wise (Joel 2:30-32, Isaiah 30:8-11; Daniel 12:10; Hebrews 11:7; Revelation 12:17, 19:10).
  - They stand blameless before God and men (Daniel 6:22); Jesus Christ blots out their sins and imputes His righteousness to those who love Him so that they will be able to stand faultless before His glorious presence (Joel 3:16-21; Zechariah 3:1-4; Jude 1:24, 25; Revelation 14:1-5; Malachi 3:2-4; 2 Peter 3:10-14).

These are they who allow the Holy Spirit to chisel and refine their characters through complete surrender and consecration to Christ, before His Second Coming (Gen 6:5-8; 1 Kings 6:7; 18:3,4; 19:18; Isaiah 4:2, 6:9-13; Ezek 6:8, 9; 14:21, 22; Zephaniah 3:13; Acts 1:15-17; 2:15-21, 25-32; 3:12-18; 5:1-11; Romans 9:27; Rev 12:17). [see Saints, Ensign, Wheat, Repairers of the Breach; Gift of Prophecy, Wise, Overcome; Scatter, Purge/Purify, Sons of Levi, Seal (of God), Sifting/Shaking, White Robes (Raiment); Rebuilding the Alter of the Lord; ? Pull Away the Shoulder/Stopped the Ears/Hearts as an Adamant Stone]
|||Rending of One's Clothes||When done in sincerity, the outward show of a broken heart, a heart made tender. The High Priest was never to rend his clothes because they were consecrated to God. Caiaphas, the High Priest in the time of Christ, in pride, self-righteousness, and demonic contempt, tore his clothes as a sign of disgust against Jesus Christ (2 Kings 22:10, 11, 19; Joel 2:13; Matthew 26:57-65; Leviticus 21:10).
|||Repairers of the Breach||(Isaiah 58:12; Micah 7:11, 12) [see Path of the Just / Paths to Dwell in; Rebuilding the Alter of the Lord]
|||Revival(ing)||The mercy and grace of God to restore a remnant of that which had been dead/dormant/captive so that it may live again. With the revival, God re-establishes His temple (spiritual - body of believers) wherein He may dwell; repairs the former desolations, restoring the Old Paths and Foundations of Many generations; and restores the walls, the commandments that are a protection against the stormy blasts (Ezra 9:8, 9; Jeremiah 6:16; Isaiah 58:12, 13, 28:5, 6). [see Path of the Just / Paths to Dwell in; Wall (The)]
|||Right (Side)||The side or position of strength, approval or favor. The Lord Jesus sits on the right side of His Father in heaven. The righteous (sheep) will stand at the right side of the Lord in judgment while the wicked (goats) will stand to His left (Zechariah 3:1-5; Luke 1:11-13). [see Hand (Right)]
|||Righteousness||"My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness"(Psalm 119:172); "right doing, and it is by their deeds that all will be judged. What reveals our characters is what we do. The works show whether the faith is genuine." (Christ's Object Lessons, pg 312 by EGW)
|||Righteousness by Faith||To first be crucified with Christ so that He may live-out His life of righteousness within; denying oneself, taking up one's cross, and following Jesus (Galatians 2:20; Matthew 16:24). Accepting Christ's imputed righteousness by faith that His righteousness may be made manifest within (Romans 3:20-22; Zech 3:1-5; James 2:23; 2 Peter 1:1); the experience the remnant will have of believing in Jesus (gospel), understanding God's prophecies of the judgment of the world, and living by faith in the Son of God (Heb 11:7; Rom 4:3; Heb 11:8-12). God's approval of the righteous when by faith they embrace His promises, even amid seemingly impossible odds (Habakkuk 2:3, 4; Romans 4:17-22; Galatians 5:5, 6; Hebrews 10:35-39). [see Faith of Jesus, Garments (whitened)/Cloth (New), Vision (mar'eh: Hebrew), Remnant]
|||Rivers and Streams||That which comes from the rains poured out by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit Himself will flow as Rivers and Streams during the time when God is gathering in His people, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall (Isaiah 30:23, 25, 26). [see Latter Rain]
|||Roar of the Lord||God's wrath being poured out as an angry lion upon His enemies. His roar is that which shall shake the heavens and the earth before the wicked (Joel 3:16; Isaiah 2:19; Amos 1:1-3; Hebrews 12:25-27; Revelation 5:5)
|||Robbers (spoilers)||Those who ultimately break in pieces, violate, bruise, scatter and destroy the people of God without room for restoration (Isaiah 42:22-25; Daniel 11:14; 7:23; 8:13, 23, 24; Nahum 2:2; Genesis 3:15); Rome, both pagan and papal are the robbers, breakers and violators of God's people. Pagan Rome bruised Jesus and would utterly break the nation of Israel; Papal Rome bruised the saints for 1,260yrs and Modern Rome will trample upon the people of God in the last days. [see Breaker; Bruise]
|||Robes (White)||That which is given by Jesus to the saints when they accept Jesus as their Savior. The robe of righteousness is Christ's righteousness, which is woven in the loom of heaven and has no trace of human instrumentality. We must have Christ's righteousness, lest we be found naked, unclothed and bearing our own righteousness which is as filthy rags. The robes are our characters which Jesus desires He make white and purify by His grace and that He sustain [we keep white] through daily renewal and regeneration in the Holy Spirit (Isaiah 64:6; Revelation 3:18, 16:15; Philippians 2:5-8).
|||Rock||Jesus Christ (Deuteronomy 32:3, 4, 15; Psalm 18:2, 31; 61:2; 62:7; 94:22; 95:1; 1 Corinthians 10:4; Ephesians 2:20; 1 Peter 2:6; Matthew 16:18; Isa 32:2); The Eternal Kingdom (Daniel 2:34, 35, 44, 45); The People of the Eternal Kingdom (Daniel 2:34, 35; Jeremiah 51:19-23, 33; 1 Peter 2:4, 5; Psalm 144:12). [see Stone]
|||Rock (of Shebna)||Shebna, the treasurer and head of the house for King Hezekiah of Judah, who through the works of his hands, carved out a sepulcher (Isaiah 22:7-21) as a stronghold. As a leader among the people, Shebna appeared as one with great faith in a position of importance but within he was "full of hypocrisy and iniquity" (Matthew 23:27, 28). Because he failed to put his trust in the God of heaven to be his strength (2 Kings 19:32-35) but rather sought to ally with the Egyptians against Assyria and trusted in the works of his hands, God promises to overthrow him, carry him away [by the King of the North - Assyria (Isaiah 22:17, 30:1-7; Jeremiah 13:15-20)] and appoint another whom the Lord would raise up (Eliakim) in his place. This prophetic allusion is a reference to those who trust not in the Rock of Ages (Deuteronomy 32:3, 4), Jesus Christ, but in their own works to save themselves; those who hew their own gods as their defense (Deuteronomy 32:31-38). [see Overthrown]
|||Rough Wind||The Four winds that bring about calamity upon the earth (the works of Islam that are a catalyst for the enforcement of Sunday Laws, followed by the 7 Last Plagues). The time preceding the blowing of these winds, the sons of Jacob are purified (sins are blotted out and God's name written in their foreheads) but the sons of wickedness receive the Mark of the Beast. The Rough Wind is being restrained until the East Winds complete their work (Isaiah 27:8; Revelation 7:1-3). [see Winds (holding the four), East Winds, Time of Trouble]
|||Sackcloth||Course mourning clothes; worn during periods of judgment, fasting, penitence, and deep contrition; (Jeremiah 6:26; Rev 11:3; Jonah 3:5-9; 1 Kings 21:27)
|||Sabbath (The)||Meaning "rest", 7th day of the week (Saturday); sign/symbol/ensign of a relationship for those who are sanctified by God (Ezekiel 20:12, 20; Jeremiah 17:19-27); the "bond of the covenant" or the Seal of the Commandments of God indicating His authority as Creator, Redeemer, and the mind of Christ (Ezekiel 20:37; Exodus 20:8-11; Rev 7:2-3; 14:1; Psalm 96:4, 5; Philip 2:5-11); symbol of rest in God as our Creator (Genesis 2:1-3) and rest in God as our Redeemer from the bondage of sin/slavery (Deuteronomy 5:12-15; Luke 4:18-21); the Sabbath brings refreshing and restoration (Exodus 31:17, Acts 3:19, Isaiah 56:1-7, 58:12-14); S-ABBA-TH - the Father is in the midst of the Sabbath, it is His seal. [see Ensign]
|||Saints||1. The faithful people of God throughout all ages that serve Him; The jewels in Christ's crown; stones in Christ's Spiritual temple; the called and beloved of God; those who call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ (Daniel 7:21, 25, 27; 12:3; Isaiah 28:5; Malachi 3:16, 17; 1 Peter 2:5; Romans 1:7; 1 Corinthians 1:2) [see Remnant, Wheat, Host of Heaven1]
2. The angelic host who will accompany Jesus at His Second Coming to the earth (Jude 1:14; 3SG 55.3) [see Host of Heaven3]
|||Salt||A purifying agent; an agent for saving grace; offered with each sacrifice, salt is a symbol of Christ's righteousness that restrains and preserves men from evil, just as salt preserves from corruption (Lev 2:13; Mark 9:49). Any offering offered without salt lacked the righteousness of Christ. Therefore we, as living sacrifices, must receive the salt of Christ's righteousness so that we may become the salt of the earth. Christians are to become agents of saving grace, healing, cleansing and preservation (2 Kings 2:19-22; Rom 12:1, 2; Matt 5:13).
|||Sanctuary (miqdash - Heb)||Word used in Daniel 8:11 signifying a sacred place, temple. The use in this verse is to identify the temple of strength for paganism, the place where paganism was magnified and exalted [ruwm - Heb. meaning to lift-up]. [see Daily (the); Sanctuary of Strength] Sanctuary (qodesh - Heb): - word used in Daniel 8:14 to signify a place of holiness, sacredness; the apartment in the heavenly sanctuary where holiness abounds (Most Holy Place)
|||Sanctuary of Strength||A term used to denote the city of Rome or more specifically the Roman Pantheon (Daniel 11:31), the sanctuary of the pagan gods that was forsaken by pagan Rome when it universally converted to Catholicism, the Abomination of Desolation. Rome, unlike other nations that boasted of the superiority of its gods in gaining conquest over the nations it subdued, adopted, and incorporated the gods of the foreign nations into its host of worshipped gods so that paganism was exceedingly exalted under Rome (Daniel 8:9, 10). All the relics of pagan worship including the ceremonies and priests which ministered over the gods were housed in the Roman Pantheon. Today, the Roman Pantheon is fittingly a Roman Catholic Church dedicated to Mary (the Queen of Heaven) and the Martyrs. [see Pantheon; Sanctuary (miqdash - Heb); Daily (the); Abomination of Desolation; Transgression of Desolation]
|||Sardis (Church of)||The 5th of seven prophetic churches described in the Revelation, denoting a particular era of the Christian Church history. The Protestant churches coming out of the Dark Ages of the Church of Rome, lost much of its original faith. Jesus admonishes it to "strengthen those things that remain that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God". Jesus encourages the church to remember the pure, simple means by which they first received and heard the gospel of Christ, by faith, unlike the vain rituals and ceremonies promoted by the Harlot Church. He further encourages the few who have kept their garments to remain faithful so their names would not be blotted out of the Book of Life (Revelation 3:1-6). [see Thyatira, Philadelphia]
|||Scarlet/Red (color)||Blood, sacrifice for sin (Isa 1:18)
|||Scatter||God's punishment towards a people for apostasy, rebellion, and committing iniquity involving being taken captive by one's enemies, death by famine, pestilence and sword, the destruction of the land, and the dispersing [scattering] of the people among the heathen nations (Ezekiel 5; 6:12-14; 22:15; Zechariah 7:14) for an appointed time. The initial scattering of Samaria (the Northern Kingdom) began with Assyria in 723BC and was accomplished [finished] 2,520 years later (Daniel 12:7) in 1798. The initial scattering of Judah (the Southern Kingdom) began with Babylon in 677BC (Jeremiah 50:17-20) and was accomplished 2,520 years later in 1844. Four nations (horns) were known to have scattered Ancient Israel and Judah, namely Assyria/Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome (Zechariah 1:18-19). Scattering typifies the Mystery of Iniquity, where those who live in opposition to God are gathered for the purpose of being destroyed, scattered, and overthrown. [see Indignation (the Lord's); Seven Times (scattering), ? Gather]
|||Seas||Multitudes of people (Isaiah 17:12); 2the mass of the wicked who will be as the chaff on the summer threshing floor that will be driven away by the Lord (Isaiah 17:13; Psalm 1:4; Daniel 2:35). [see Waters]
|||Sea and Earth (Angel stands upon)||A global, worldwide message that goes to the densely and sparsely populated regions of the earth respectively (Rev 10:2, 5, 8). [see Waters]
|||Seal (of God)||Symbol, sign, or token of God's perfect character written on the foreheads of the saints by the work and indwelling of the Holy Spirit (Rev 7:1-4, Rev 14:1-5; 2 Cor 1:22; Eph 1:13; 4:30); 2A symbol, sign, or token of God's authority to rule over heaven and earth and all their inhabitants (Exodus 20:8-11; Deuteronomy 5:12-15; Ezekiel 20:12, 20); 3A distinguishing mark that identifies the true followers of God versus all others - the sealing (protection and salvation) of the true followers of God [see definition 1] by Christ Himself precedes the close of man's probation and the execution of judgment and involves a settling in of the truths of God's covenant to men both intellectually (the forehead) and spiritually (the heart). (Isaiah 58:11-14; Ezekiel 9:4-6; Rev 7:1-4, 13-17; Rev 14:9-11; Ezekiel 3:9 & Exodus 28:36-38; Jeremiah 31:31-34). [see ? Mark of the Beast (the)]
|||Seals (seven)||The seven seals that have kept close the wisdom and knowledge of God and His righteousness contained in the Bible since the foundation of the world (Matthew 13:35) is nothing other than men's traditions. Traditions handed down from generation to generation and the human interpretation of Scriptures (i.e. spiritual darkness in time of Christ, Dark Ages, Jews preach law and no gospel, Christians preach gospel and no law) hid from men the truth as it is in Jesus Christ. Truth has been buried beneath a mass of tradition but the Lion of the Tribe of Judah has prevailed to unseal these truths (Revelation 5:1-5).
|||Sealing Ange||The highest of Angels clothed in white linen - Michael, Jesus Christ Himself, is the One who, speaking with authority, commands the angels to hold the four winds of strife until He places the Seal of God upon the forehead of the faithful (Ezekiel 8, 9; Revelation 7:1-3; Daniel 10:5, 6; Revelation 1:13-16, 10:1-6, 18:1-3)
|||Seed||1.Seed for the sower is the Word of God, given to all but bringing forth fruit in those who receive the Early and Latter Rains of the Holy Spirit (Isaiah 55:10; Mark 4:14; 1 Peter 1:22-25; 1 Thessalonians 2:13) so that they may share the same message of life with others.
2. Offspring or heirs; one's descendents (Genesis 3:15; John 8:44; Galatians 3:16)
|||Seed of the woman||prophetic reference to Jesus Christ (Genesis 3:15), the first male child of God's true Church and the One in Whom all promises are made and fulfilled (Galatians 3:16). 2All sons of obedience who are made righteous and holy by the unmerited works of Jesus Christ; the church, the bride of Jesus Christ. [see Wheat]
|||Seed of the serpent||The sons of disobedience who foolishly scorn and forsake their Creator God and His perfect plan of redemption for a manmade counterfeit of their own choosing. Those who war against Jesus Christ and the sons of redemption throughout time (Genesis 3:15; Matthew 3:7). [see Wise (Wisdom) of this World]
|||Seven Churches||prophetic revelation regarding the history of the church from the time of the Apostles until the end of time.
|||Seven Mountains||Historically, the city that sits on seven hills is Rome [Quirinal Hill, Viminal Hill, Capitoline Hill, Esquiline Hill, Palatine Hill, Caelian Hill, Aventine Hill]. A prophetic allusion to the identity of the beast from the Abyss given in Revelation 17:9. [see Bottomless Pit3]
|||Seven Plagues||Judgment upon the inhabitants of the heavens, earth, seas, and fountains of water (Rev 14:7) before the 2nd Coming of Christ to reveal God's glory and His wrath upon those who worship the Beast and receive the mark of his name. As the Israelites among the Egyptians in the time of Moses (Ex 7:14-12:30), the plagues will fall upon the unrighteous but the sealed of God will be spared. (Rev 16:1-21; 2 Peter 2:9)
|||Seven Spirits of God ||Holy Spirit (Rev 4:5; 5:6)

|||Seven Thunders||"a delineation of events that would transpire under the first and second angels' messages" (E.G. White CTr pg 344). Prophetic passages uttered by seven thunders, given to John the Revelator before being given the book to eat. John is commanded by the voice of the Father from heaven, not to write down the utterances of the thunders but to seal them up. The message of the seven thunders parallels the writings of the book of Daniel that were once sealed until the commencement of the Time of the End; similarly, the utterances of the seven thunders will be unveiled before the Close of Probation (Revelation 22:10, 11). The utterance of the thunders remain sealed up during a time of the increase of knowledge because the people of God in the Last Days, like the Nation of Israel, have forgotten the Paths to Dwell in, and have neglected the knowledge of the truths entrusted to them. The response from the Loud Cry uttered by the Lion of the Tribe of Judah (cause to effect), detailing the events which occurred during the sounding of the 1st and 2nd Angel's Messages (1798-1844), will be repeated and unfolded in the last days.

    1989 - Time of the End - Fall of Communism (King of the South) through intelligence between Beast & False Prophet - Daniel 11:40 is fulfilled
    
    Details
    The fall of the Soviet Union occurred through craft and intelligence held between the United States and the Papacy, a union that Time Magazine labeled "The Holy Alliance". Through the military and economic strength of the US and the social unrest stirred up by the subversive agencies of the Papacy, the USSR was left bankrupt in the Cold War arms race. The coming together of this Protestant Nation [the False Prophet] under the influence and direction of the Papacy [the Beast] is nothing less than the woman mounting the scarlet colored beast in Revelation 17:3
    
  2. Occurrence in Early Adventist History
    August 11, 1840 - Collapse of the Ottoman Empire as foretold two years in advance by Josiah Litch, applying the day/year Bible prophecy principle to the prophecy of Revelation 9:15 - Islam is restrained (1st Angel's message is empowered)
    
    Occurrence at the End of Adventist History
    September 11, 2001 - the Third Woe begins, and radical Islam is restrained. The 4th Angel of Revelation 18 descends, empowering the 2nd and 3rd Angel's Message - Rev 11:14, 18:1-3
    
  3. Occurrence in Early Adventist History        
    June 1842 - in April 1842, 300 copies of 1843 time chart [prophesied by Habakkuk 2:2] printed by Charles Fitch and preached by 300 Millerite preachers resulting in 1st Angel's message being rejected by Protestant churches. Message proclaimed: 1the gospel of Jesus Christ; 2Fear God and give Him glory alone because His time of judging the world has arrived; 3Worship the God of Creation and Redemption by keeping His commandments, including the 4th Commandment - Rev 14:6, 7; Ex 20:8-11; Deut 5:12-15
    
    Occurrence at the End of Adventist History
    An image to the Beast is erected where church and state are joined and the state plays the role of enforcer of the moral decrees of the church. The image could be the nationalization of Gay Marriage (a moral/religious institution that will be legislated by the state) a National Sunday Law in the USA, an unrighteous decree, or some other act where the state legislates morality with the church's endorsement
    
    Details
    "When the churches of our land, uniting upon such points of faith as are held by them in common, shall influence the State to enforce their decrees and sustain their institutions, then will Protestant America have formed an image of the Roman hierarchy." Spirit of Prophecy volume 4 pg278 by EGW The rejection of the 1st Angel's message by mainline Protestantism signaled its "fall" from grace and God's protection. Choosing to hold onto the doctrines of Rome rather than faithfulness to God and His Word, the claim of the Protestant Reformation, the churches made themselves a reproach for which God would soon issue a 2nd angelic message stating "Babylon is Fallen, is Fallen..." Charles Fitch, the publisher of the 1843 Time Charts was first to produce an article in 1842, proclaiming the Protestant churches to be part of Babylon and that God's people should come out from her.
    
  4. Occurrence in Early Adventist History
    Marc 21, 1844 - 1st Disappointment (Beginning of Tarrying Time and prelude to the Midnight Cry) - Matthew 25:1-5. Misunderstanding that the Day of Atonement and Feast of Ingathering were fall festivals, the early Adventists mistook the end of the 1843 calendar year (spring time) to be the time of Jesus' coming (cleansing of the sanctuary) [GC 373, 374; Early Writings 236, 237]. This led them to further search the timing of the actual decree issued in 457BC where they discovered the "fullness of the year" miscalculation: "It was not at first perceived that if the decree did not go forth at the beginning of the year 457 B. C., the 2300 years would not be completed at the close of 1843. But it was ascertained that the decree was given near the close of the year 457 B. C., and therefore the prophetic period must reach to the fall of the year 1844. Therefore the vision of time did not tarry, though it had seemed to do so. We learned to rest upon the language of the prophet: "The vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry." Habakkuk 2:3." [CET Chpt 5- The Disappointment] The human misunderstanding of the prophecy leading to a disappointment, inaugurated a tarrying time, which God used as a test to purge His flock of those who had a spurious faith in His Word. The prophet Daniel, when giving the message of the 1335 prophecy foretold that there would be a blessing for those who waited until the 1843 had ended, signifying a delay or tarrying in the Bridegroom's coming until the simultaneous fulfillment of the 2300-day and 2520 prophesies in 1844 (Daniel 12:11, 12; Isaiah 30:18; Early Writings 236.1-237.1)

    Details
    The time of Spiritual Israel's visitation has arrived when God shakes out all that will be shaken (Hebrews 12:27). Those in Adventism who have not built upon the Rock, who are over taken by the overflowing floods and the winds of strife, who have not been planted by the waters of life, and have not drunk of the Latter Rain message will find themselves barren, lacking the oil of the Holy Spirit and will yield to the global Sunday Law test - Matt 7:24-27; Jeremiah 17:5-8
    
    
  5. Occurrence in Early Adventist History

    Given first in measure but then without measure, the Latter Rain of the Holy Spirit will be poured out upon the faithful who are watching unto prayer, to proclaim the 3rd Angel's message to the world.
    
  6. Occurrence in Early Adventist History 
    August 12-17, 1844 - 2nd Angel empowered - Exeter Camp Meeting (Midnight Cry) - Matthew 25:6-12. Brother Samuel Snow helped William Miller and other early Adventist pioneers understand their confusion in the marking of time as he conveyed the 7th month movement, concluding on October 22, 1844. It is at this camp meeting that the actual date, October 22, 1844 is first preached, based on the Jewish (Karaite) reckoning of time, and the message "Behold the Bridegroom Cometh" was made prominent. The Midnight Cry gave power to the 2 nd Angel's message
    
    Occurrence at the End of Adventist History
    Passage and enforcement of a global Sunday Law, prohibiting Sabbath worship and enforcing Sunday worship; the nations will be angry with the faithful of God, signaling the start of the Little Time of Trouble prior to the close of probation for the world - Rev 13:14, 15; Last Day Events chpt10 pg 143 by EGW. Proclamation of the Loud Cry by the 4th Angel of Revelation 18 joining the first three angels in giving the final warning to the world ["tidings from the east and north shall trouble him" - Daniel 11:44 is fulfilled]
    
    Details
    The Midnight Cry is paralleled by the Loud Cry, giving the final warning message to mankind to flee from the wrath of God. At this time, the King of the North [the Papacy] will be stirred by the Loud Cry message [tidings from the east and north] and will marshal his last attempt at destroying the commandment-keeping people of God. In so doing, a Sunday law that marks the closing of probation for Adventism (shut door message, and 2nd temple cleansing as with the Protestant churches at the Midnight Cry) will be levied.
    
  7. Occurrence in Early Adventist History        
    October 22, 1844 - Michael stands-up, Shuts the Door of the 1st apartment in the heavenly sanctuary and enters the 2nd. The 3rd Angel's message arrives and prophetic time is no more. The second cleansing of early Adventism takes place before God establishes His denominated church movement. Rev 11:19, 10:6; Daniel 8:14
    
    Occurrence at the End of Adventist History
    Michael stands-up; Close of In both eras, Michael stands-up, signaling the change Probation for mankind and  of a dispensation and work of Christ. Christ standing up at the end signals the close of mankind's probation Time of Jacobs Trouble (Daniel 12:1, 2) is fulfilled; Rev 22:7- 12. Marks the second and final temple cleansing where there are two classes of people upon the earth: Matthew 21:12-15; 23:37-39.
    
    Details   
    In both eras, Michael stands-up, signaling the change of a dispensation and work of Christ. Christ standing up at the end signals the close of mankind's probation (the Shut Door that none can open) as Christ exchanges His priestly robe used during intercession for judgment, for His Kingly robes that He will wear as a conquering King. The Time of Trouble when God pours out His plagues upon the earth will ensue - Rev 15,16

The increase of knowledge prophesied by the Angel of Revelation 22:10 which said "Seal not the
sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand", will serve as testing truths for the people
of God before producing two classes, one that receives the Seal of God and the other the Mark of the
Beast (Revelation 10:3, 4; Revelation 5:5). [see Three Angels' Message; Path of the Just / Paths to
Dwell in Lion of the Tribe of Judah, Book (sealed)]
|||Seven Times (scattering)||a prophetic statement giving reference to curses, punishment, and destruction that is to occur after a period of seven times: Children of Israel marched around Jericho seven times (Josh 6:2); Covenant curses pronounced upon Israel for disobedience, seven times (Lev 26:18-46); Nebuchadnezzar heated his furnace seven times hotter (Daniel 3:19); Nebuchadnezzar was afflicted seven times for his pride and not giving honor to the true God (Daniel 4:16). [see Number #2,5201 [scattering], Scatter]
|||Seven Times (gathering)||A prophetic statement giving reference to blessings, restoration or purification that is to occur after a period of seven times: Jesus cast out demons from Mary Magdalene seven times; Naaman the leper was told to dip himself in the Jordan seven times; a leper is sprinkled with water and blood seven times before being pronounced clean (Lev 14:7); after a period of seven- times of scattering, God gathers His last-day remnant church (a host) to enter into covenant with them while simultaneously cleansing (justifying) the sanctuary [temple of the body's sins are blotted out and the heavenly sanctuary] (last end of the indignation - Daniel 8:19) [see Number #2,5202 [gathering], Gather, Indignation (the)]
|||Shaking (the)||Time of testing, hour of temptation where each individual's faith is tested to see if they shall stand. The Shaking, brought about in its fullness by the enforcement of the Image to the Beast causing those who have tasted of the good news and have eaten the Little Book, but have not built on the rock, having little soil, little moisture, and shallow roots (a surface religion) to be shaken and removed (Job 19:10; Hebrew 12:27). These are they who attempt to serve both Christ and self, being lukewarm; self has not been crucified. The effects of the Shaking is the identification of the wheat and the tares that are to be gathered in separately at Christ's return (Revelation 3:9; Revelation 13:3, 8; Nehemiah 5:13; Matt 13:5, 6, 20, 21; Luke 8:6, 13; Hebrew 12:25, 26; Joel 3:16; Jeremiah 25:30-33; Malachi 3:13-18). [see Hour of Temptation, Mark of the Beast, Wheat, Tares, Lukewarm]
|||Shaking (of the powers of heaven and earth)||The powers in the heaven to be shaken are the sun, moon and stars and the powers on earth to be shaken are the leaders on earth. [Early Writings pg 41 by EGW]
|||She-ar-jash'-ub||Name of the first son of Isaiah the prophet whose name was appointed by God meaning "The remnant shall return" or a "causeway". This prophetic name was to give encouragement to king Ahaz and God's people of the restoration of a remnant of Israel by way of a causeway (highway), after the Lord appointed His hireling the Assyrians to punish His wayward son Israel (Isaiah 10:5, 6, 16-22; 11:10-13, 16, 12:1-6). Because of their idolatry, seeking of false gods, pride and self-assurance, the Lord would shave the heads, beards, and feet of Israel (Isaiah 7:18-20). Yet God promised abundance of milk and honey to those who know to refuse the evil and choose the good. The name She-ar-jash'-ub (Isaiah 7) and his brother's name denote a gathering and a scattering respectively pronounced upon God's people as part of the covenant blessings and curses spoken in Leviticus 25 and 26 . [see Ma-her-shal'-al-hash'-baz, Bee of Assyria, Gather]
|||Shepherd||A pastor, priest, overseer or church leader. A keeper of sheep and a guide for the flock; a good shepherd ensures the sheep are safe, protected and well fed with God's Word; a bad shepherd feeds himself from off the sheep, neglects the weak and feeble, offers contemptible sacrifices, and scatters the flock (1 Samuel 16:11, 19; John 21:15-17; Acts 20:28; Jeremiah 23:1-4; Ezekiel 34:1-10; Malachi 1:6-8, 12-14). [see Cattle (fat/lean)]
|||Shepherd (the Good)||Jesus Christ (John 10:1-18; Luke 12:32; Jeremiah 23:4-6)! One who lays down His life for His sheep (1 Samuel 17:34-36; Zechariah 13:6, 7); leads His sheep in green pastures, beside still waters and in the paths of righteousness, being King of Righteousness (Psalm 23; Ezekiel 34:11-16, 22-31). [see Messenger (of God); Prince of Peace; BRANCH (the); Hireling]
|||Shepherd (Idol)||not idle (as in lazy) but idol (idolatrous; demonic)! An allusion to the false system of religion that prides itself in its wealth and idolatries. This shepherd is seen as unconcerned with, and a destroyer of the flock. Judgment is pronounced upon him that his arm (strength) shall be dried up and his eyes (wisdom) darkened (Zechariah 11:16, 17). An allusion to the Papacy and its fate as described in Revelation 18. [see Abomination of Desolation, Tyrus (Prince of); Flock of Slaughter]
|||Ships||Economic strength, trade (Psalm 107:23; Rev 18:17-19; 2 Chronicles 9:21, 22)
|||Ships of Chittim||The land of Chittim is spoken of in Isaiah as the place from whence news of the destruction of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar is heard. The "isles" of Chittim (Tarshis) in the Aegean and Ionian Seas were the places of refuge for those who fled from the Babylonian siege. Chittim, or Carthage was the place from whence the Vandals under Genseric (428-477AD), began their naval military siege of Rome shortly after the transfer of the empire's seat from Rome to Constantinople (330AD). Rome, Under Majorian and then under Pope Leo I proved powerless to ward off Genseric and his hosts. The Arian Vandals, and later Goths and Heruli who would attack, presented a threat to the Catholic faith of Rome. Because of the threat of Arianism, Justinian in 508AD would decree the Pope the sole interpreter of the scriptures and further ban the scriptures from common use, causing "indignation against the holy covenant" (Daniel 11:30, 8:12; Isaiah 23:1-6; Revelation 8:8, 9)
|||Ships of Tarshish||The economic strength of the world that will be broken by the East Wind. The Ships of Tarshish are said to sing of the glory, wealth and splendor of the kingdom of Tyrus in her markets that are replenished by the seas; a spiritual allusion to the glory wealth and splendor of the Papacy that is enriched by all the peoples of the world. (2 Chronicles 9:21, 22; Psalm 48:7; Isaiah 23:1-5; Ezekiel 27:24-27, 32-36; Revelation 18:15). [see Tyrus; East Wind]

|||Shut Door Message||Noah heard a Shut Door Message from the Lord that caused him to move with godly fear to build an ark to the saving of his soul and his family and the condemning of the world (Hebrews 11:7). A message leading up to and including the Hour of Temptation announcing the impending close of a probationary period and the end of an Investigative Judgment (Isaiah 42:14; Matthew 25:8-13; Matthew 23:37-39; Luke 11:47-51; Heb 11:7; Rev 3:18-22; Jeremiah 14:10-12; Jonah 3:1-4). The prophet of the Lord calls this message and the events associated with it "Great and Solemn Events" that all must fully know before their culmination. This message is often taken with indifference or hostility by those who are spiritually blind and/or deaf (1 Samuel 2:27-3:18; Isaiah 42:18-25; Matt 11:16-26). Those who ignore the Shut Door Message will be under strong delusion, having been lulled into complacency and a false sense of security through a Peace and Safety message, though the door of mercy had already been shut. Such was the case in the following instances:
  - The antediluvians after the door to the ark had been shut, had become complacent for 7 days where they saw no noticeable change in the atmosphere, until the 8th day when the earth was rent, the heavens broke open and all who were not in the ark perished
  - The Children of Israel in the time of Eli the High Priest, who through neglect and irreverence to God in raising reprobate sons, allowed the lamp of the Lord to go out in the sanctuary, causing the glory (presence) of the Lord to departed from Israel because of open sin. Yet, the people in pride, thinking that God would never forsake them despite their rebellion, took the Ark of the Covenant out to battle against the Philistines not knowing they were without the Lord's protection. They were slaughtered and the Ark was captured (1 Samuel 4)
  - The parable of the 10 virgins portrays the 5 foolish virgins returning to the Bridegroom after going to purchase oil, seeking entrance to the feast though the door had already been shut and they were left outside (Matthew 25:1-13)
  - The Nation of Israel by 34AD met the close of their probation with the stoning of Stephen and had corporately rejected Jesus and their position of honor as God's called and chosen people to represent Himself to the earth. God's grace delayed their judgment for 36 more years as Divine Mercy allowed the children of the people of that generation to decide what they would do with Jesus and His message of Salvation. Thinking that the Lord would defend them against the Romans, and not heeding the miraculous escape of the Christian believers from Jerusalem by the hand of the Lord, the Jews stood to fight the surrounding Roman armies, confident that God would deliver them, yet they were overthrown for good in 70AD (Deuteronomy 28:45-68).

The shut door message for Adventism is portrayed in Isaiah 5:1-7 and 27:1-5 and the door of probation will literally close for Adventism at the passage and enforcement of the Sunday Law. Yet, many will not believe the forewarning that God will scatter those who lose/ignore/forsake the message of the 2520 prophecy in condemning His denominated church (Isaiah 29:14; Habakkuk 1:5; Acts 13:40, 41; Job 33:14) [see Midnight Cry, Hour of Temptation, Blindness/Deafness (Spiritual); Closed Door; "Peace and Safety"; Number #2,520; Overthrow; Scatter]
|||Sifting/Shaking||Separating the wheat from the tare among the church members (Amos 9:9, 10; Luke 22:31); separating those which can and will be shaken (in faith) from those who cannot be (Hebrews 12:27) [see Harvest/Reap]
|||Sigh & Cry||The response of the wise who receive the "Grievous Prophetic Message" revealing the perilous, unconsecrated condition of the world [and the church] and the impending close of probation, the coming destruction. The righteous sigh and weep for those who have not yet made the decision to follow Christ wherever He goes (Ezek 9:4; 21:6, 7; Ex 2:23; Rom 8:27, 28; Daniel 10:1-3; Malachi 3:13-18; Jeremiah 9:1-3, 10:19-22, 13:16, 17; Isaiah 22:4, 61:2, 3). These are they who are written in God's book of Remembrance (Malachi 3:13-18). Yet, the Lord offers comfort to His people stating "They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves [with him]." (Psa 126:5, 6). These are also those who "Cry aloud, spare not, showing God's people their transgressions and the house of Israel [the Church] its sins (Isaiah 58:1). [see Watchmen, ? Weeping and Gnashing]
|||Sign of Jonah (Jonas)||The prophet Jonah was prophetically foreshadowing Christ when kept in the belly of the whale (Jonah 2; Matthew 16:4). The captivity in the "heart of the earth" [meaning being captive to this world, to the wilds thereof, and to its ruler, Satan] that Jesus experienced is reflected in the elapsed time of Christ agonizing and bearing the weight of sin for mankind in the Garden of Gethsemane on the Mt. of Olives [Thursday night] (Luke 22:39-53), Christ's wrongful trials, imprisonment, and beatings [Thursday night/Friday morning] (Luke 22:54-23:27; Mark 14:46-15:20), Christ hanging and dying on the cross [Friday afternoon/evening] (Mark 15:25-37), and Christ reverencing the Sabbath day that He created by resting in the grave [Friday sunset through Saturday sunset, rising from the grave early Sunday morning] (Mark 15:38-16:6). By this reckoning of time alone can the prophecy be fully understood that Jesus would be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights (Matthew 12:40).
|||Signet (Ring)||That which is used by an authorized individual, entrusted by a king or royal official to wear and to verify/ratify official documents on behalf of the king. Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah is likened unto Christ in that he was first an authentic descendent of David and of the royal lineage of Israel, and secondly He was commissioned by God to lay the foundation of God's temple (Zechariah 4:6-10; Haggai 2:1-5; 1 Peter 2:6-10). In the day of God's judgment when all the earth is shaken and the nations of the earth overthrown, Jesus will stand as God's signet ring before His people (Haggai 2:21-23).
|||Silver (tried in the fire)||Perfected Christian character (Proverbs 17:3, 66:10; Psalm 12:6; Zechariah 13:9; Malachi 3:3)
|||Sinful Kingdom (the)||A stark rebuke against the Northern Kingdom of Israel spoken by the Lord for the dire condition it found itself in. Amos the prophet was sent to plead the cause of God to the people who in hardness of heart rejected the message and listened to false priests and prophets such as Amaziah. As a result, utter destruction and complete scattering was pronounced upon the kingdom (Amos 9:8, 9, 5:1-27; Isaiah 7:1-8). [see Scatter]
|||Sleep||1. Term used to denote death (John 11:11-14); death to self - the condition the prophets felt when confronted with God's glory and righteousness (Isaiah 6:5; Daniel 10:8). [see 2Naked (to be)]
2. The spiritual condition of those who do not heed the warning of the True Witness to be sober, vigilant and watchful. These are they who do not make preparation for the Lord's return through fasting and prayer that they enter not into temptation, but are lulled into complacency by the deceptive peace and safety message, they become drunken with the wine of dissipation, and will not escape (the hand of the papacy), but will be overthrown. Christ illustrated those who sleep spiritual in the parable of the unprofitable servant (1 Thessalonians 5:1-11). [see "Peace and Safety"; Drunk (to be); Hand (of the Papacy); Overthrown]
|||Smoke (from Bottomless Pit)||Mohammadism. [see Islam]
|||Smyrna||The 2nd of seven prophetic churches described in the Revelation, denoting a particular era of the Christian Church history. Smyrna is a persecuted church that bore much affliction at the hands of the natural born Jews and the Pagan Roman government (60AD+). Jesus foretold the trials this church would endure as Satan attempted to snuff-out the flock of God. John's own experience of banishment on the island of Patmos gave account of the sufferings of Smyrna (Revelation 2:8-11). [see Ephesus; Pergamos]
|||Sodom (spiritual)||Moral degradation, licentiousness (Ezek 16:46-55), Apostate Religion/Apostate Protestantism (Rev 11:8, Gen 18:16-21); utter rebellion against godliness [pride, lives of ease without compassion for the poor, haughtiness] (Jeremiah 23:14; Isaiah 1:9-17)
|||Sodom & Egypt (spiritual)||The licentiousness of Sodom and Atheism of Egypt under Pharaoh was the moral characteristics of the Nation of France (King of the South) during and after the French Revolution, giving birth to the Beast from the Abyss (Rev 11:7, 8; 17:8). [see Beast from the Abyss (Bottomless Pit); Spiritualism]
|||Soil||One's heart and/or mind (Matthew 13:3-18-23)
|||Song of Moses & the Lamb||An experience of both Moses and Jesus that the 144,000 will experience. The experience of taking a close of probation message to an obstinate people (Laodicea) who refuse to hear or accept the message. [see Closed Door]
|||Son of David||Jesus Christ. Prophetic title ascribed to the Messiah for which Jesus was often referred by those who believed in Him (Isaiah 9:6, 7; Matthew 15:22, 20:30, 31; 21:1-9, 22:41-45; Luke 1:31, 32; Romans 1:3)
|||Son of Man||1. (ben -adam: Heb) literally translated "son of Adam" the name referring to all members of the human race born of the seed of Adam (Ezekiel 2:3)
2. (Huios tou anthropou: Grk) term meaning son of man but referring to Jesus Christ. It is He who pleads on behalf of man to God (Job 16:21)
|||Sons of God||A term giving reference to the celestial heads of the worlds that God created, including the earth. Adam is the son of God who had dominion over the earth until, through rebellion he forfeited his post, which in turn was usurped by the devil. Jesus however, the Second Adam has won back the keys to the earthly kingdom from Satan through His death on the Cross. (Genesis 1:26, 2:15; Luke 3:38; Psalm 8:3-9; Job 38:1-7; Job 1:6; John 12:31-33, 18:36; Matthew 5:45, 12:28-30; Luke 4:5, 6; Hebrews 1:2, Hebrews 11:3). A term referring to all who by faith, embrace God's Everlasting Covenant and through the faith of Jesus Christ, are redeemed to God (Genesis 6:2; John 1:12).
|||Sons of Levi||Those who remained faithful to God during the rebellion of the Children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai when Aaron made a golden calf for the people to worship. The Sons of Levi did not participate in the rebellion, but remained faithful to the Lord. Further, the Lord commanded them to do the most difficult task of killing their kinsmen who rejected repentance but remained in their rebellion, demanding to return to Egypt and its ways. By performing this difficult task, they consecrated themselves more fully to the one true God and established their contempt for the heinous acts of idolatry. As a reward for their faithfulness, they were appointed to replace all the firstborn of Israel who were killed as a result of the rebellion, and became the priests of God. Like their forefather Jacob, the Sons of Levi received no earthly inheritance (land allotment) in the Promised Land because God was their inheritance and exceeding great reward (Exodus 15:1). The Sons of Levi will be those who remain faithful to the Lord in the End Times, refusing to worship the modern golden calf, the Image to the Beast. The Lord promises to purify them and make them fit to stand before the Holy God at His coming (Genesis 15:1; Exodus 32:20-26; Numbers 3:11-13; Deuteronomy 21:5; Malachi 2:4-7, 3:3). [see Purge/Purify; Image to the Beast]
|||Sons/Daughters/Children of Men||The rebellious [descendants of Cain] who through ignorance, denying the apparent evidences of God through Nature, and rejecting truth deny God and His Everlasting Covenant. The antediluvian Sons of God2 who in rebellion to God's commands and counsels began to marry the daughters of men brought upon themselves God's wrath, for threat that there would be no righteous seed left in the world to fulfill God's Everlasting Covenant. The sons of men, who once were in ignorance of the mystery of God are to be taught God's plan of creating one holy body in Himself of Jew and Gentile to fulfill all righteousness (Genesis 6:1-3, 5-7, 11:5; Psalm 31:19; Daniel 2:38; Ezekiel 31:14; Ephesians 3:1-7). [see Tares]
|||South (country, side, -ward)||From an unused root meaning to be parched (Strong's Concordance - 5045) The Negeb or Southern district of Judah; South of Palestine which relates to Egypt.
|||Sovereign Lord (God)||God, The Father
|||Spirits||1. Living men and women (Numbers 16:22, 27:15, 16; 1 Peter 3:18-20)
2. Angels, supernatural beings (both holy and unholy) that have the power to transform their appearance, and perform signs and miracles. Holy spirits (angels) go about doing God's will on the earth, as ministers to the sons of men. Unholy (evil) spirits seek to deceive, possess (take control) and ultimately destroy the sons of men (Psalm 104:4; Hebrews 1:13, 14; Zechariah 6:1-5; Leviticus 19:31; Revelation 16:13, 14; Matthew 8:16, 10:1; 2 Thessalonians 2:9; 2 Corinthians 11:13-15)
|||Spirit and in Truth||Jesus in speaking to the Samaritan woman at Jacob's well told her that the time will come where the true worshippers of the Father will neither worship in Samaria nor Jerusalem but will worship Him in spirit and in truth (John 4:23). Jesus speaks of the two "dimensions" that must be developed in the Christian life, made possible by the indwelling Holy Spirit, so that the believer may be complete in Him, and that our worship may be pleasing to God:
  - Spirit: The Holy Spirit is He who enables the believer to walk in newness of life in Jesus Christ. The daily renewal of the Holy Spirit in one's life (baptism of the Spirit) empowers the follower of Christ to walk in the Spirit, so that he does not fulfill the lusts of the flesh. Further, the Holy Spirit enables us to fulfill the righteous requirements of God's Law, namely complete obedience, just as Jesus walked in complete obedience to the Law (Romans 8:4; Psalm 119:10-12; Hebrews 10:5-7; 1 Samuel 15:22). The Holy Spirit is given as a gift to the believer at baptism (Acts 2:38) and He desires to make His residence in one's life to fill him with overflowing rivers of water unto eternal life (John 4:14; 1 Corinthians 6:19).
  - Truth: The Holy Spirit, called the Spirit of Truth, is given to the believer in order to guide and direct him into all truth (John 16:13). The truth in which we are to be direct is none other than the counsels given in God's Word, the Bible, namely the Laws and Testimonies. Jesus prayed the Father to "sanctify [His children] by thy truth, thy word is truth" (John 17:17). Therefore it is the Word of God, the writings of the Old [and New] Testament, the Law and the words of God's prophets that Jesus points to as that which sanctifies and makes His people ready to meet God in peace. By inspiration, Isaiah counsels that the Ten Commandments and the writings of the prophets must be the standard by which all truth is measured when he wrote "To the Law and to the Testimony, if they speak not according to these words it is because there is no light in them" (Isaiah 8:20). [see Law and the Prophets (The)]
|||Spirit of Prophecy||The Holy Spirit of God Who's testimony of Jesus provides insight to future things to come (Revelation 19:10; John 16:13; Acts 10:38-43; Luke 24:26, 27)
|||Spiritualism||"...spirits of devils, working miracles, [which] go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty" (Revelation 16:14). Multi-faceted demonic masterpiece of the devil whose origins date back to the fall of mankind in the Garden of Eden and made widespread by the Beast from the Abyss (Rev 11:7). Demonic, spirit driven delusions, doctrines, teachings, and beliefs whose foundational principles are centered in either the erroneous doctrines of the immortality of the soul (Gen 3:4), or man being god himself - gadal, the spirit of self-exaltation (Genesis 3:5). One of three key components that comprise Modern Babylon (Rev 16:13, 19) used to gather the majority of the world to battle against God and His last day people. The spiritual deceptions, based in large part on the counterfeit Holy Spirit that deceptively manufactures "fire from heaven" bringing about false revivals and miracles of healing, accompanied also by manifestations of demons that defy biblical principles such as the unconscious state of the dead, will accomplish the work of gathering the world to accept and advocate Satan's masterpiece, the "Christian Sabbath" or Sunday sacredness. Those who profess to follow Christ, and even those who are among God's remnant church movement exhibit Spiritualism in the following manner:
  - The Body without the Breath
  - Justification without Sanctification (once saved always saved)
  - The way without the Truth
  - Form of godliness without Power
  - Love without the Law
  - Godhead as consisting of only 2 Individuals; the Holy Spirit is a force/essence
  - Faith without Works

Spiritualism is made popular in the world through the following influences, teachings, and movements:
  A. Transformism: Demonic influence/force placed upon objects within a certain environment that drives adaptation to the environment in order to remain within the environment (survival). Most evident with those in the church who initially stand for truth amidst apostasy, but through coercion/persecution/ridicule/apathy adapt (compromise) to the malaise of the environment. Those who refuse to adapt are either forced out of the environment or are marginalized by the majority, being left to sigh and cry for righteousness. This characteristic gives reason to Darwin's Adaptation of Species. [see Lukewarm, Sigh & Cry]
  B. Romanticism/Universalism: Demonic doctrine or ideology that God is too-loving to punish the wicked. In essence, no one is so bad to deserve God's wrath and in turn God is love to the extreme, excusing sin and saving men in their sins rather from their sins (Malachi 2:17). The doctrine: 1 minimizes the significance of the Cross; 2minimizes God's hatred for sin and its heinousness; 3lulls its adherents into a spirit of compromise and presumption towards sin - some of whom even believe they have a pact with the grave and death, thinking it will never overflow them (Isaiah 28:15, 18); 4is established by the popular demonic doctrine that God's immutable laws have been abrogated, that men are no longer bound to uphold them but that men will be saved by [cheap] grace without the need for obedience and the change of character that are the fruit of grace. This last point which emphasizes the love of God in the absence of obedience is diametrically opposed to the true Bible teaching, which is the love of Christ constrains us and compels us to uphold the righteous requirements of the Law (Romans 8:1-4). This point is often promoted through the emphasis of God's grace and free gift of salvation to the exclusion of the need for sound doctrine and obedience. The Bible itself and its fundamental teachings of the creation, God's works of redemption and sanctification as well as the universal judgment are all rationalized through human reasoning and teachings and are superseded by men's self-exalting doctrines and fables. This doctrine suggests that all will be in heaven and that the teaching of hell fire and punishment are merely scare tactics to try to modify behavior (Zephaniah 1:12). Universalism also stresses the acceptance of all world religions (Christianity, Judaism, Islam, etc.) as valid paths to God, a key tenet of the Ecumenical Movement. [see Ecumenical Movement]
  C. Eroticism: Sensual demonic force that plays upon man's lower passions and appetites (food/sex)in order to overwhelm man's God given capacity to reason and think. Sexual experiences emit endorphins that create a stimulant "high". Spirit of eroticism promotes perversions to God's pure, intended use of sex so that man becomes lower than beasts in their actions (Rom 1:26-29; 2 Peter 2:10-14; Jude 1:7-10), further corrupting the image of God in which he was originally created by his drive, desire, and exploitation of sexual pleasure (James1:13-15). The result of man's extended sensual abuses leaves a person feeling empty, helpless, shamed, guilty, worthless, and ultimately doomed/cursed. [see Sodom & Egypt]
  D. Pantheism: Demonic belief that God is everywhere, inside of everything, and is everything. Founding principle of the term "Mother Earth or Mother Nature", where the earth gives birth and has life within itself, and is therefore a god. Suggests nature is a god, the sun a supreme god giving life to the earth, and men themselves are also gods. The creation story explicitly shows that God alone is the author of all life in that He calls forth and sustains all vegetation and plant life before He creates the sun, moon, and stars (Genesis 1:9-19; 1 Corinthians 8:6; Acts 17:28; Daniel 5:23). Like Deism, Pantheism denies the existence of a personal and loving God whose plans are to benefit His creation. A foundational principle in Wicca, Eastern, and Indigenous People's religions, Pantheism promotes the belief in reincarnation (Cyclicalism) where beings die and return in other forms through a "circle of life". The U.S. Educational system in the late 19th and early 20th century, adopting a Global or Holistic Educational curriculum that promoted skill based training for the advancement of a global workforce (human capital), as opposed to seeking to develop the students natural abilities and capacity to reason for themselves through traditional curriculum of the arts, sciences, math and reading, advocated an emphasis on rote training and controlling the students minds while offering instructions on environmentalism, vegetarianism, pacifism, population control and Pantheism as core facets of the curriculum. Common terms used under pantheistic teachings include: forces, energies, one's spirit, auras, atmospheres, (w)holistic teachings, the separation of the body from the spirit. Acceptance of this belief opens the door for communicating with, and being influenced by the dead, or rather, crafty satanic demons in disguise as the dead (1 Samuel 27:11-20). [see Craft]
  E. Skepticism/Cynicism: Demonic spirit of doubt towards God, His Word contained in the Bible and its truths. Promotes the idea that truth is to be sought outside of God through reason, enlightenment, science, education, and man's intellectual advancement. Gives rise to philosophical reasoning, Higher Criticism of the Bible, purely scientific studies on the origins of life. The demonic power works upon its followers who, though "they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools." (Romans 1:21, 22) Skepticism/Cynicism is a foundational doctrine of the religion of Evolution.
  F. Atheism: Demonic spirit of doubt towards God, His works of creation, and truth in general. Promotes the idea that there is no God, and therefore mankind is the pinnacle of wisdom, knowledge, and reason. The spirit exhibited by Pharaoh that denied any knowledge of the true God (Exodus 5:1, 2), suggesting He is non-existent. Embraced by followers of the Evolutionary Theory (religion) to deny the existence of God. Those who embrace this ideology through willful ignorance find it comforting (bliss) to deny God so that no accountability (knowledge of right/wrong and truth) or homage is required of Him (Romans 1:18-32). [see Sodom & Egypt]
  G. Humanism: Demonic doctrine exalting man as his own god and subject only to his will or opinion. Fosters the spirit of relativism, where what's good for you is good for you, and what's good for me is good for me... This spirit denies any absolute truth (right/wrong) and therefore leaves no room for criticism, correction, doctrine, or reproof. Teaches that "man is the creature of progression; that it is his destiny from his birth to progress, even to eternity, toward the Godhead." Further it asserts that "Any just and perfect being is Christ." Christian humanists often come to practice salvation by works based on their own merits, good deeds, and self-righteousness; this delusion of salvation by works is the polar opposite of the Romanticists' idea of universal salvation for all, based on the blind love of God. [quotes taken from the Great Controversy by EG White Spiritualism; pg 554]
  H. Deism: A false concept of God that leads men to a wrong pattern of conduct. The belief that there is a God, but He is conceived as an absentee Ruler who cares little for His people and pays little attention to them. God had according to this belief, created the world and left it to its own evolutionary processes. God's promises of blessings and warnings of punishment are alike meaningless under this philosophy and He is therefore, no different from the gods of the heathen (Zephaniah 1:12, Colossians 1:16, 17; Hebrews 1:3). [see SDA Bible Commentary on Zephaniah 1:12]
  I. Spiritual Formation: Doctrinal teaching, founded by Ignatius Loyola of the Jesuit order of the Church of Rome that promotes the adoption of spiritual mentors, or guides who train a "novitiate" in spirituality and beliefs. The novitiate is taught to follow the counsels of the mentor implicitly, without question as if the explicit word of God. This indoctrination places men in the place of God to govern moral thought and actions. This doctrinal teaching based on antichristian principles has been embraced by prominent evangelical and Christian churches (Rick Warren, Bill Hybels).
  J. Contemplative Spirituality: teaches that a certain atmosphere is required so that your senses, your eyes, ears, nose and skin can feel the presence of something supernatural. The principle emphasizes emotional, sensational, experiential worship in a certain "atmosphere" that plays upon the senses and feelings rather than the mental reasoning and promptings of the Holy Spirit. This teaching and its practices causes its adherents to be susceptible to the counterfeit spiritual fire from heaven that is called down in the sight of men (Revelation 13:13). [see Fire (Strange)] 
  K. Feminism (Christian): demonic doctrinal interpretation, advocacy, and church practices that challenge the authority of the Bible, the will of God, and rationalizes feminine equality in church affairs as a civil or human right. Unlike the counsels of God that call for the church to be a light to the world, the church has adopted the ways of the world under this movement (erupting from the social feminist movement) as it seeks to acquire equal privilege, access, and representation in duties ordained by God for men alone. The social feminist movement in many respects was born of misogynistic and oppressive social "norms" that required women to "keep to their place" in society. In response, the social feminist movement can be perceived as an uprising of women against those oppressive norms and embracing of the rights, opportunities, and privileges long withheld. Though not spoken from so forceful a position, the Christian Feminist movement embraces some of the subtleties of the social feminist movement including the "human right" to pursue any and all roles defined by the church, the "need for equality and fairness" by breaking down gender distinctions through "gender neutrality", and the suggestion that "ability and proof of capability" are sufficient qualifications for church offices. These rationalizations inherently question the justice and integrity of God, suggest human rights supersede the will of God, and paint the Bible as a socially biased and outdated book rather than it being the timeless inspired word of God. Though men may not understand nor agree with the will and counsels of God, it is the Christian's blessed privilege to submit to His wisdom knowing His ways are higher than our own. The church's embracing of social feminism is the sown wind leading to the ordination of women elders, the ordination of women pastors, and the contemporary challenging of other biblical/doctrinal tenets, the whirlwind (Hosea 8:7). [see Spiritualism - Homosexuality; Elder]
  L. Homosexuality: Satanic perversion of the natural role and use of men and women that resulted in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Romans 1:24-32, Jude 1:7). The Bible directly speaks against this sin as an abomination and great perversion of the original image of God; yet, modern society has embraced this scourge and its influences as a social norm. It is the feminist movement that has empowered the modern homosexual movement where its practice is now seen as a viable life choice and its universal acceptance is required on the basis of "gender neutrality" and "human rights". With the floodgates opened by the Christian Feminist movement for the ordination of women elders and women pastors, ordination of openly homosexual ministers has become the natural progression in several mainstream denominations based on the humanistic principles of "human rights", the "need for equality and fairness", "gender neutrality", and "ability and proof of capability" as sufficient qualifications for church office. [see Spiritualism - Feminism (Christian)]
  M. Personification of Human Intelligence: Satan's first deception on earth took place in the Garden of Eden where he led the woman to believe that the serpent was endowed with human-like intelligence/wisdom/knowledge and abilities (speech and reason) after partaking of the forbidden fruit. The deceptive illusion was a lure to draw the woman to question God's integrity, to covet the things for which she already had, namely being created in God's image, and lastly to become her own god, independent of God. Today, this has become commonplace and made to seem harmless through movies and cartoons where animals or even fruit [VeggieTales] are shown to be endowed with human intelligence. Though harmless to the developed [adolescent/adult] mind that can reason that such things are mere myth, the innocent and unguarded child's mind is impressed with concepts that defy God's order of creation
|||Spring Time||Period of time (first month - March) when the trees begin to bud by the work of the early rains, given in measure by the Holy Spirit (Isaiah 27:8, 18:5). Similarly, a spiritual sign to Adventists that the Latter Rains are falling as the trees begin to bud (Joel 2:23, Luke 21:29-33; James 5:7). The time when the locusts (grasshoppers - Islam) are being formed (Amos 7:1) [see Latter Rain, Summer]
|||Spue thee out of My mouth||the response of Christ to the Laodecian who remains in a lukewarm condition and has been overthrown. The Holy Spirit translates our prayers, mixing it with utterances we know not to give and presents it to Jesus Christ. Jesus, through His own mouth presents our petitions to the Father who grants the desires of our prayers according to His riches in glory. When we have been rejected of Christ, we no longer have a Mediator/Intercessor and Christ spues our prayers out of His mouth (Job 19:6, 7; Isaiah 55:11, 59:15, 16) [see Overthrown; Cry Aloud]
|||Stand in the Gap (or Make Up the Hedge)||To make intercession or to advocate; a worthy representative (Ezekiel 22:30).
|||Stand in thy lot||A term used in Daniel 12:13 meaning the time in which the prophetic revelations given to him are to meet their fulfillment, commencing with the First Angel's Message (Revelation 14:6) at the commencement of the Time of the End.
|||Stars||1. Angels/Messengers/A Spiritual Leader (Rev 1:20; 12:4). The reference to stars must be taken in the context of the realm of heaven being spoken. [see Host of heaven1, 2, 3]
2. The Apostles or the saints of God (Revelation 12:1, 1:20; Daniel 8:10, 12:3). The reference to stars must be taken in the context of the realm of heaven being spoken. [see Host of heaven1, 2, 3] 
|||Stone||Jesus Christ, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, the foundation and chief cornerstone of Zion upon which God's eternal Kingdom is built (Isaiah 28:16; Daniel 2:35,44, 45; 1 Peter 2:1-10; Luke 6:47-49, 20:17, 18; 1 Corinthians 3:9-11). [see Rock]
|||Strange Woman||See Woman (Harlot)
|||Streets||A reference to the prophecy of Daniel 9:25 indicating the rebuilding of the Streets and Walls of Jerusalem, even in troublous times. In truth, Nehemiah and those who returned with him to Jerusalem endured opposition to their work, having a sword girded to them as they performed their work (Nehemiah 4:18). This rebuilding of the Streets in the time of Nehemiah is an allusion to the Last Day rebuilding of the ways and Old Paths long forgotten by the last generation (Jeremiah 6:16, 17). [see Troublous Times, Walls (The)]
|||Subtle||Slyness, cunningly deceptive, intriguing, demonic craftiness, having a greater awareness of a matter and using the knowledge to influence/manipulate (Genesis 3:1, 2 Samuel 13:3-5, 30-33; 14:1-20; 15:1-6; James 3:14-16; Luke 16:8). [see Craft]
|||Summer||Period of time when the Holy Spirit is poured out without measure to gather in the wheat and fruit of righteousness (Time of Harvest, End of the World) before Michael stands-up. Also signifies the time of Probation's close (Proverbs 6:8, 10:5; Isaiah 16:9; Jeremiah 8:20; Daniel 2:35; Amos 8:1-3; Matthew 9:37, 38, 13:39; Revelation 14:14-16) [see Spring Time, Harvest/Reap]
|||Summer Fruit||A symbol of God's close of probation for His people during the time of Amos. The summer fruit were ripe, where God would harvest the good fruit among His people and destroy the chaff (Amos 8:1-3)
|||Sun||That which gives light; the Old Testament (Rev 12:1; Psalm 119:105, 130; Matt 25:1-4)
|||Sun of Righteousness||Jesus Christ! (Malachi 4:2) [see Messenger (of God), Morning Star (Bright and)] Sun, Moon, & Stars - symbols and objects of idolatrous worship (Jeremiah 7:18; 8:1, 2; Ezek 8:16; Rev 16:8, 9) given by God for light, signs, seasons, days and years (Genesis 1:14; Jeremiah 31:35), not to be worshipped. [see Host of heaven2; High Places, Groves, Alters]
|||Sunday Law||[see Image to the Beast]
|||Supper of the Great God [The Lord's Sacrifice]||The culmination of the great battle of Armageddon will result in the overthrow of all earthly kingdoms and the utter destruction of the earth. The corpses of the enemies of God will lay strewn upon the earth and the Lord will call for the birds of the air to feast upon their carcasses, commencing the Millennial period where the devil and his imps will be imprisoned upon the earth (Abyss) to reflect upon the pain and suffering they have caused. While the Supper of the Great God is happening for every fowl and unclean bird on earth, the Marriage Supper of the Lamb will be occurring in heave for the redeemed of the Lord. (Ezekiel 39:17-21; Jeremiah 4:23-27; Zephaniah 1:7, 8; Revelation 19:17-21). [see Armageddon; Bottomless Pit/Abyss; Gog; overthrow; ? Marriage Supper of the Lamb]
|||Sword||The Word of God, the Bible (Rev 19:15, 19:21, Eph 6:17, Heb 4:12)
|||Synagogue of Satan||The Jews in the time of Christ and His Apostles; the church of Rome during the Dark Ages; the apostate Protestant Churches at the end of time, that have turned their back on God and His truths and have embraced the doctrines of the Great Whore, Babylon (Revelation 2:9, 3:9; 1 Thessalonians 2:13-16; Galatians 1:13, 14). [see False Prophet (the)]
|||Tares||Also called briars and thorns (Isaiah 27:4), sprigs and branches (Isaiah18:5, 6), foolish virgins (Matthew 25:8-13), city without [latter] rain (Amos 4:4-8); These are plants not planted by the Father but will be rooted out (Matthew 15:13); they are the wicked, sons of disobedience, seed of the serpent, and sons of men who are scattered among the wheat by the enemy. These serve not God, but persecute the wheat (Galatians 4:28, 29) attempt to choke the wheat but will be overthrown and gathered at the time of harvest to be burned in the fire (Malachi 3:14-4:4). These are they who when instructed by the messengers of God [prophets] to repent and reform their ways say "See not... prophecy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophecy deceits: Get ye out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us." (Isaiah 30:8-11; Jeremiah 5:26-28; Matthew 13:23-30, 36-43, 49, 50; Galatians 4:30; Ephesians 5:1-7). [see Briers and Thorns, Leaves (only), Sons/Daughters of Men; Seed of the serpent; Vine (of the Earth); Vessels of Wood and Earth; Cattle (fat/lean); Harvest/Reap, Dead (in sin), Overthrown, Pull Away the Shoulder/Stopped the Ears/Hearts as an Adamant Stone; False Prophet (the), ? Wheat]
|||Tarrying Time||A period of time during which God extends His mercy to His people (Isaiah 30:18) before He cleanses His temple, enters into covenant with His chosen people (builds His church/temple), and a great revelation of His glory is made known.
  - The two angels that come to Lot at night to warn and save him (typifying the 1st and 2nd angel's messages - era of rebuilding God's church) are told to tarry in his home for the night (Genesis 19:1, 2)
  - Jacob tarries in Luz where God appears to him and enters into covenant with him. Jacob vows to remain faithful to God, eating only the bread [doctrine] He provides (Genesis 28:11-22). [see Ladder]
  - Moses was on the mountain top for 46days when he received instruction on building the tabernacle and God revealed His glory to Him (Exodus 33:17-34:9)
  - The temple dedicated to God and built by Solomon required 46yrs to build (John 2:20)
  - The Disciples tarried 46days in Jerusalem from the time of Christ's resurrection for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit during which, revelation of the scriptures was made plain to them (Acts 1:15-7)
  - The covenant church of God tarried 46years after the Beast had received its deadly wound (1798AD), and received revelations of last day truths (Rev 10:10, 11).

Tarrying time of March 22, 1844 until August 1844 revealed an increase of knowledge that clarified the error of 1843 and made plain October 22, 1844 as the true Anti-typical Day of Atonement, when Christ would suddenly come to His temple that He had been building (Malachi 3:1, 2; 1 Peter 2:1-10). The last day church will also experience a tarrying time during which the Holy Spirit will be poured out through the Latter Rain [message] to empower the church to give the end time Loud Cry (James 5:7, 8). [see Closed Door, Latter Rain, Number #46; Loud Cry]
|||Temple of God (House/Building of God)||God's spiritual temple which is the church, the body of Christ being built up. Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone of this temple and all who come to Him become stones within the building. Also a reference to the consecrated human body that is the temple of the Holy Spirit that abides within (Zechariah 4:8-10; 1 Peter 2:4-8; 1 Corinthians 3:9-17; Hebrews 3:3-6; Malachi 3:1; Amos 9:11-15; Acts 15:13-18).
|||Tenth Part of the City||A reference to the prophecy of Revelation 11:13 where 1/10 of the formerly divided Roman Empire, namely France, collapsed due to the French Revolution, a spiritual earthquake. The hour of this upheaval was marked by the rejection of the Bible and it being burned in the streets, mass bloodshed and the rise of the Beast from the Bottomless Pit, the demonic force of Spiritualism. [see Earthquake; Beast from the Abyss (Bottomless Pit); Spiritualism]
|||Terrible of the Nations/Terrible Ones||A prophetic reference made to the nation of Babylon but foreshadowing Pagan Rome, which in turn is a type of the Papacy and Modern Rome (Isaiah 25:4; Ezekiel 28:1-7; 30:10, 11; 31:11, 12; 32:11, 12; Habakkuk 1:6, 7; Daniel 7:7). [see Babylon (Mystery)]
|||Testimony of Jesus||The Spirit of Prophecy (Rev 12:17; 19:10; 22:9); the prophetic gift given by the Holy Spirit to God's [remnant] church to guide, instruct, clarify, give wisdom, and prepare God's people to meet Him with whitened robes (Rev 19:7, 8; 3:18; 16:15); the Spirit always directs God's people to worship the God of Creation and Him alone (Psalm 19:7, Rev 14:7, Acts 4:19-24).
|||Three Angels' Message||Last day testing messages (Revelation 14:6-12; Evangelism 613.1) entrusted to a people near the end of earth's probation that is to be spread world-wide by men through the empowering of the Holy Spirit (John 16:7, 8) according to the economy of grace, "freely you have received, freely give" (Matthew 10:8). The Angels themselves represent the people of God who are working in harmony with the universe of heaven (Life Sketches, pg 439 by EG White).The Three Angels' Messages appear in type throughout scripture (Matthew 2:1-13; Luke 14:16-24), though their antitypical proclamation has been reserved to the time of the end, when God's Judgment is to commence, the apostate system of Babylon is clearly identified, and the "mark" of that false system of religion is to be enforced by law. The Three Angel's Message brings down the doctrine of the counterfeit trinity [the Dragon, the Beast and the False Prophet] (Isaiah 8:9-13), and has the effect of separating the wheat from the tare [as reapers] where one class accepts their message and is gathered together for harvest, and the other class is gathered together to be burned. The Three Angel's Messages also liberates God's people from spiritual Babylon and catalyzes the work of restoring/rebuilding God's Temple, His Spiritual House and Remnant Church, just as the three decrees in the time of Ancient Israel liberated Ancient Israel from the land of Babylon and enabled them to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem in 46years (John 2:20). The workers who are appointed to give the messages are typified in the prophecy of the dried bones in Ezekiel 37, signify a work of reformation, repentance, and resurrection to righteousness is required for those same messengers.
  1. First Angel's Message: Ezekiel 37:7, 8 - A composite message commencing with the gospel, a joyous message of Jesus Christ's love for all the world, made known through the prophets and confirmed in history; a call to worship the true and only God, the God of Creation (Exodus 20:8-11; 1 Chronicles 16:26); and a solemn message of warning that is to stir-up fear that the time of God's judgment hour in heaven has arrived (Matthew 10:28). The people to carry the message are foreshadowed in the parable of the valley of dead, dried bones in Ezekiel. The dried bones in the hearing of this prophetic message are brought together and flesh is given to the dead bodies but there was still no life or breath (Spirit of God) in these dead bodies. The message causes a shaking among the people (dead bones), yet they still do not have the Spirit of God poured out upon them to empower them to take the message to the world. The early fulfillment of the prophecy occurred in the time period 1831-1842 under the teachings of William Miller of the Advent Movement. The followers of William Miller and other Adventist ministers around the world read and believed the prophecies of the Old and New Testaments with regards to the events to occur after the 1,260years of spiritual Darkness and prior to the Second Coming of Christ [Time of the End]. Through a God ordained misinterpretation of prophecy, the "cleansing of the sanctuary" (Daniel 8:14), thought to be the cleansing of the earth of sin and the Second Coming of Christ, was the message of another divine event of great importance, namely the commencement of judgment for the world in the second apartment of the sanctuary in heaven. With the detailed prediction of the conclusion of a prophecy spanning 391 years and 15 days, two years in advance, and its pinpoint fulfillment on August 11, 1840, power from heaven was given to the Advent message and messengers to preach the First Angel's Message with authority. It is at this time in 1840 that the advent message was empowered and for those who had eaten of the little book for years, it became sweet in their mouths (Revelation 10:8-10). The fervent searching of scripture and the revelation of biblical truth that was characteristic of the Advent Movement has a parallel today. Those who since 1989 have understood the events pertaining to the fall of Communism at the hands of the two great world powers of the Papacy and the United States to be the fulfillment of the Whore Babylon mounting the scarlet red beast (Revelation 17, Daniel 11:40) respectively understand this history to be repeated. Though understanding was revealed at the time, there was power only in measure from the Holy Spirit to accompany the spreading of the message. [see Daily (the); Number #2300; Seven Thunders;]
  2. Second Angel's Message: Ezekiel 37:9-11 - Proclaimed during the summer of 1844, a message of warning and admonition regarding a closing door of probation that drew approximately 50,000 people from the ranks of apostate Protestantism and Romanism. A message to flee the apostate churches of Protestantism that had rejected the counsel of the First Angel is made manifest in the Second Angel's message. The vessel of Protestantism, raised up by God through the counsels of the Bible in order to protest the church of Rome and its false and demonic dogmas, had rejected the cry to embrace the gospel and prepare to meet God during the thought hour of His judgment. Closing its door on the message, the Protestant churches chose to remain in darkness to the God ordained cry and thus become an extension of the worldly system it was raised up to protest. Therefore the statement "is Fallen, is Fallen" refers to the once pure Protestant movement that claimed to have based all of its doctrines and teachings from the Bible alone [though splintered into various sects], that had verily reverted to the church from which it claimed to have protested. This message of warning is given to all sincere believers of Christ to flee sin, come out of the false systems of religion, and forsake all of their practices while embracing true Christian principles, founded solely on the Word of God in preparation to meet Jesus. The sounding of this angel's message will reach its climax when the churches fully join hands with the world in erecting an Image to the Beast. The prophetic foreshadowing of the sounding of the 2nd Angel is given by Ezekiel prophesying to [petitioning ] the four winds [the Holy Spirit] to give life to the dead bodies that had been shaken and stirred by the First Angel's Message. The early fulfillment of the prophecy occurred in the time period of 1840-1842, again, under the Advent Movement pioneered by William Miller. The Advent message of Christ's eminent return, a message identifying the close of human probation, was given to the mainline Protestant churches during this era. During the summer of 1842 the leadership of the Protestant churches closed their doors to the Advent message and its teachings and forced its advocates out of their congregations. A concurrent prophecy detailing the effects of the three Angel's message upon the faithful is presented in Revelation 7:1-4, which reveals four angels holding four hostile winds while the people of God are sealed by the Holy Spirit of God on their foreheads. The modern parallel of the Advent Movement experience is the sprinkling of the Latter Rain, commencing after September 11, 2001, where prophetically the Rough Winds are stayed while the East Wind blows. The four hostile (rough) winds of strife that are soon to befall the earth at the close of man's probation are withheld, while the East Wind, a symbol of Islam blows upon the earth (Isaiah 27:8). This truth is confirmed by the prophetic revelations understood in the Bible that by 1842 were codified on the first of two charts (2nd chart in 1850), "written on tables and noted in a book" (Habakkuk 2:1-3), affirming the first two woes of Bible prophecy to be Islam, and therefore the third woe, commencing on 9/11/2011 also to be Islam (Revelation 8:13). When one can perceive the U.S. and the united governments of the world placing a constraint on Radical Islam after the year 2001 through the universal "War on Terror" as a parallel to the constraint placed on Islam by the European powers on August 11, 1840, then one has understood the hidden prophetic parallel given by the Bible. By this position, debate begins in contemporary Adventism, over the Sealing Message (Isaiah 27:8).

  3. Third Angel's Message: Ezekiel 37:12-14 - When God brings His people back to life by pouring out His Spirit upon them, then they shall know who the Lord is, and then they shall know who they are, a mighty army raised up by the Lord, and the Remnant of God's true Church throughout Bible history. The army will be empowered to preach a message of restoration of the old waste places and to raise up the foundations of many generations trampled down through men's traditions and false doctrines (Isaiah 58:12-14; Matthew 17:11). The third angel's message, first preached after the Great Disappointment of October 22, 1844, announces the impending end of judgment and the close of probation for all men on earth. The message also lays down the gauntlet and forces all men to make a choice for either worshiping the true God of Creation, revealed through the Fourth Commandment or worshiping the man-made, spurious sabbath (Sunday), the Beast, and the Image to the Beast (Luke 11:23; Revelation 14:7; Exodus 20:11). The Third Angel's message is the present truth message of righteousness by faith, where those who like Noah, hear a strong prophetic message of warning, move and act upon the message with godly fear unto the saving of their lives (Hebrews 11:7). Those who hear the Third Angel's Message must settle into its truth both intellectually and spiritually; their minds must understand and perceive the veracity and urgency of the message, while they must demonstrate heart-felt appreciation through embracing and acting in obedience to the message; thus yielding the experience of Righteousness by Faith. The urgent, fearful message of the Third Angel will cause the sincere to search the scriptures [eat the book] to better understand the work required to heed the warnings of the message. As earnest searching is made and understanding is granted by the Holy Spirit to the precious truths and unmerited promises listed in the Bible, the believer will see his own faults, unworthiness, and struggles with sin in light of the requirements of being faultless, blameless, and sinless in order to receive those promises. As the humble supplicant bows before God, confessing his sins and unworthiness, while trusting only on God's unchanging, merciful character, Jesus lovingly imputes and imparts His own righteousness and character upon him. The work of the Third Angel's message is that of cause and effect for the true believer which prepares him to meet Jesus Christ without sin, bearing Christ's own character, and in His peace.

|||Three Unclean Spirits||Demonic messages from the mouths of the Dragon, Beast, and False Prophet that are poured out as an overwhelming plague of frogs (Genesis 8:1-14) given to counteract the Three Angel's Messages. Last day deceptions that are so convincing and profound that if possible, would deceive the very elect (Matthew 24:24; Rev 16:13-16) [see Dragon, Beast, and False Prophet; Spiritualism].
|||Thyatira (Church of)||The 4th of seven prophetic churches described in the Revelation, denoting a particular era of the Christian Church history. This is the church during the time of Papal Rome, the adulteress Jezebel, who causes God's people to worship false gods (spiritual fornication) and believe idolatrous doctrines (foods offered to idols). Christ commends this church's works, love, faith, patience and continued works of ministry despite the despotic Church of Rome. Christ is said to have given the church time to repent, just as God gave the Nation of Israel and the wicked Jezebel 3.5years time to repent of her wickedness, beginning at the command of Elijah for the cessation of rain. However, Jezebel would not repent. Christ admonishes that He will destroy the fruit/children of the false church system sown as tares among the saints and will judge all according to their works; while encouraging the faithful of Thyatira to hold-fast to their faith (Revelation 2:18-29). [see Jezebel, Tares; Pergamos; Sardis]
|||Time of the End||Prophetic era commencing in 1798, that has been prophesied by many of the prophets and is marked by a dramatic increase in knowledge of the scriptures and end time events, as the Holy Spirit inspired men to run to and fro through the Word of God. Paul counseled that the identification of this period not be misunderstood as he wrote to the saints in Thessalonica and the saints of all times. Paul stated that the proclamation of Christ's Second Coming must be proceeded by a spiritual falling away within the church, caused by the Man of Sin and Son of Perdition (2 Thessalonians 2:1-9). God also foretold this era as a period of great spiritual reformation and revival, fulfilling a prophetic pattern found throughout the Bible (3:1 Prophecy Pattern) as the proclamation of three angels of Revelation 14 are joined by the fourth in Revelation 18. The year 1798 and thus, the commencement of the Time of the End is marked by the following historic and spiritual events:
  - Revelation 13's leopard-like beast from the sea received a deadly wound [see Beast (leopard-like)]
  - The restriction placed on proclaiming the day of Christ's coming is lifted with the coming of this era (2 Thessalonians 2:1-9)
  - The era of the First Angel's message of Revelation 14 commences. The gospel message was spread and awareness of God's prophesied judgment hour was studied and taught. Those preaching this message became empowered (the Little Book is made sweet in the mouth - Revelation 10:8-10) after their method of Bible interpretation was confirmed and the prediction of the 391 year 15 day prophecy of Revelation 9 was fulfilled exactly on August 11, 1840 with the fall of the Ottoman Empire [see Three Angels' Message]
  - The celestial signs in the stars, moon, and sun, prophesied by the prophets Moses, Joel, and Jesus Christ were fulfilled on November 13, 1833, empowering the message of Christ's soon coming and God's "cleansing of the sanctuary", preached by the Millerites

The era of 1798-1844 is a very important subset of the Time of the End because it marked the period of time in which God rebuilt His church and entered into a final covenant with a denominated group of believers (Adventists). This group, like Ancient Israel, God entrusted all of His oracles for an understanding of salvation, and to prepare a people for translation to heaven. The group therefore makes up His last church on earth. The year 1989 is significant in that it marks the "Time of the End" era specifically for Adventism as the sequence of events commencing in 1798 through 1844 are repeated to the letter and the prophesies of Daniel 11:40 were fulfilled. Interestingly, the secular periodical, TIME magazine, entitled a special issue "1989, The Year that Changed the World". (Rev 13:3; Daniel 11:35; 12:3, 4, 9). [see Day of the Lord; Latter Days; Daily (the)]
|||Times of the Gentiles||A double prophecy outlining the period of time encompassing two consecutive times of scatterings and concluding with the end of the two indignations. 1Period of two "time" (1,260year) periods, ending in 1798 and spanning two consecutive 42 prophetic month (1,260yrs) periods where the holy city (Jerusalem) and temple of God (the people - Modern Israel) were trodden underfoot. This period commenced in 723BC and continued through 538AD, covering one 1,260 year period, only to be immediately followed by another 1,260year period spanning 538AD to 1798AD. The second component of the prophecy commenced in 677BC with the scattering of Judah and continued for 1,260years until 584AD, only to be immediately followed by another 1,260year period spanning 584AD to in after which God enters into covenant with the Advent believers in 1844, Modern Israel came into existence (Acts 13:42-48; Rev 11:1, 2; Luke 21:20-24). [see Modern Israel, Great Controversy pg 329, 410]
|||Times of Refreshing||Era of earth's history when the Latter Rain is poured out from the presence of the Lord, causing the sons of God to walk in old paths, repair the breaches, seek the good way, and find rest for their souls (Jeremiah 6:16, 17; Isaiah 58:11-14; Zechariah 10:1). In repairing the breaches and seeking the old paths, the faithful servants of God will compare line-upon-line the prophetic word, revealing once hidden truths, causing the refreshing of Spiritual awareness of God's eternal purposes. The sounding of the trumpets [Loud Cry] will characterize the work of these faithful souls and will call many to righteousness, repentance and conversion resulting in the blotting out of sin (Daniel 12:3; Isaiah 44:21-23, Acts 3:19, 20). Yet for some, they "will not hearken" and "yet they would not hear" and will ultimately be shaken-out [overthrown] (Nehemiah 4:1-6; Isa 28:11, 12; Jeremiah 6:10, 16; Matt 11:16-26; Hebrews 12:25-28). Times of refreshing denote two periods of rain, the early rain in spring when the church will experience a cleansing and the latter rains of summer for the once Gentiles, when they too will be cleansed. The result of which will be the wheat will be separated from the tare [see Latter Rain, Loud Cry, Morning]
|||Times of Restitution (of all things)||The final purposes of God, and the hope of all His saints in the recreation of the image of Christ in men, our hope of glory (Colossians 1:27). God promises to have a people without spot or wrinkle that will be ready for translation from earth to heaven. The faithful during the era of the Church of Philadelphia demonstrated such a faith and God promises to raise-up a people, reclaimed from their Laodicean condition. These receive the Spirit of Christ without measure, in order to demonstrate His righteousness in men, before the world. This church triumphant will behold firsthand the eradication of sin from the universe, the restoration of all things that were lost to sin, and the recreation of a new heaven and earth by Jesus Christ through the Plan of Redemption. This prophetic hope has been preached from the beginning of the world through God's prophets (Isaiah 25:1-9; Acts 3:31). [see Fourth Generation]
|||Time of [Jacob's] Trouble||Prophetic period of time to occur after the close of man's probation when the world's fate is sealed and every person has decided their allegiance for Christ or for His adversary, Satan (Revelation 22:11, 12, Daniel 12:1; Jeremiah 30:4-7; Genesis 32:9-11). The time is marked by the rendering of the seven vials of God's wrath to His angels (Revelation 15) and the outpouring of those vials upon the earth and the King of the North (Revelation 16; Job 38:22, 23; Joel 1:10-12, 17, 18). As with the seven last plagues of Egypt, God will preserve His people whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life and protect them "in His tabernacle" from the destruction (Psalm 27:5, 6; 37:39, 40; 41:1-3; Isaiah 33:2), but the wicked will have to endure these plagues without a mediator or intercessor (Job38:22, 23). Decrees will be given to destroy God's people for the plagues, yet God will deliver His people in the midst of the destruction (Jeremiah 30:5-7; Revelation 16). [see Rough Wind; Deliver; Armageddon]
|||Time of thy Visitation||The specific testing time for Israel, commencing with the baptism of Jesus in A.D.27 and concluding in A.D.34 with the stoning of Stephen. This specific time of probation was the final week of God's covenant with the Nation of Israel before their close of probation.
|||Tower||A symbol of God's temple (place of worship), the Lord's eternal stronghold, used in the parable of Jesus describing the Lord's vineyard. A tower first appears with the creation of the city of Babel, thus foreshadowing the two-fold elements of church and state that would be characteristic of future Babylon, the power that would seek to control the consciences of men by the force of the state (Genesis 11:4, 5; Psalm 18:2, 144:2; Proverbs 18:10; Isaiah 5:1-7; Matthew 21:33-44). [see "City and a Tower"; Wall (The]
|||Traffic||Trade; propaganda/deceptions & lies, merchandise (Genesis 42:34; 1 Kings 10:15; Ezekiel 28:5, 16, 18)
|||Transgression||Sin. Particularly the sin of fornication [an illicit relationship; harlotry - seeking foreign gods; the union of church craft and state craft] when speaking of sins of the "church", Christ's bride (Daniel 8:12; Jeremiah 2:20; Isaiah 23:15-17; Ezekiel 16; Luke 21:12; Mark 13:9)
|||Transgression of Desolation||Spiritual fornication; that which was committed by the Papacy during the Dark Ages and will be restored through Apostate Protestantism with the erection of the Image to the Beast, the unification of church and state. The church is charged with forgetting her first love towards God, becoming the synagogue of Satan and in effect becoming the detestable woman Jezebel in causing God's people to worship foreign gods and idols (Luke 21:12; Mark 13:9; Isaiah 14:13; Revelation 2:9, 13, 20-23). [see Abomination of Desolation; Image to the Beast; Iron Mixed with Miry Clay]
|||Tree (Dry)||The guilty and condemned, the impenitent and unbelieving; those who spurn God's grace made available by Christ's death. The dry trees are they who shouted "Christ's blood be upon us and upon our Children". In truth, they would pay the price for shedding Christ's blood both during the destruction of Jerusalem and in the final judgment.
|||Tree (Green)||Youthfulness; The innocent; those who are not deserving condemnation because they have embraced the mercy of God made available through the death of His Son, Jesus Christ. The fate of the righteous is peace and safety forever despite the oppressions faced here on earth, thus was Christ's statement to those women mourning for compassion to the condemned Christ. (Jeremiah 11:16)
|||Trees of Righteousness||Those who become fir or myrtle trees by having heard and responded to the last day message, eating the prophetic book of Daniel and having left their condition of being briers and thorns through conversion of the Holy Spirit. These trees bud out with leaves and fruit to the world (Isaiah 61:3). [see Wheat, ? Briers and Thorns]
|||Tried/Trial/Try||the testing experience of the righteous that involves suffering yet brings about purification. The tests of trial include: imprisonment, persecution, poverty, contending with false believers, martyrdom (Revelation 2:10, 6:9-11). [see Hour of Temptation] 
|||Troublous Times||A reference to the prophecy of Daniel 9:25 indicating the rebuilding of the Streets and Walls of Jerusalem, even in troublous times. In truth, Nehemiah and those who returned with him to Jerusalem endured opposition to their work, having a sword girded to them as they performed their work (Nehemiah 4:18). The Troublous Times are an allusion to the era in which the nations were angry as a result of Islam, September 11, 2001 and hereafter (Revelation 11:18). [see Streets, Walls]
|||Trumpets||An instrument sounded by the priests for various purposes:
  - Used to call a convocation of the entire nation of Israel (Numbers 10:1-3);
  - Used to call a convocation of church leaders/elders (Numbers 10:4);
  - Sounded to give command to pack and move when journeying in the wilderness (Numbers 10:5-7);
  - Used to give warning when dangers and threats drew near the city of God; used as the armies of God went to war;
  - Used over the sacrifices during holy day feasts (Numbers 10:10);

Prophetically, the sounding of a trumpet denoted the downfall of an empire, nation or place or a dreadful battle (Joshua 6:16, 20, Judges 7:20, Amos 3:6).
|||Trumpets (Seven)||First 4 trumpets prophecy the events describing the division of the Roman Empire by the 10 barbarian tribes (Revelation 8, 9): 1st - Aleric; 2nd - Vandals; 3rd - Genseric; 4th - Odeaces. 
|||Trumpet of the Lord||God's battle cry trumpet that He Himself blows before He reaps His vengence upon the sons of disobedience (Zechariah 9:13-15; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18;
|||Two Lamp stands; Two Olive Trees; Two Witnesses; Moon & Sun||The "two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth", the Old and New Testaments. Jesus counsels that anyone who teaches of the Kingdom of God brings forth from their treasures things both old and new (testaments). This truth reveals the complete gospel, namely, the Law and prophecies/oracles given by inspiration by Christ's Holy Spirit contained in the Old Testament, and Christ's personal revelations of grace and truth (gospel of salvation) found in the New Testament. The word testament, meaning a "witness", is used to denote the two prophetic sets of writings (Old and New), spanning two eras divided by the incarnate life, atoning death, and resurrection in power of Jesus Christ. God's Two Witness like the sun and moon, or as a lampstand, sheds light on the path of the righteous and leads them from the darkness of sin and death into the light of life. It is the oil of the Holy Spirit that brings/sheds light from the lampstand. Just as the two cherubim stand before God as witnesses to His marvelous works, and between whom, God's Shekinah glory is manifested, so the Old and New Testaments emanate the light of God's truth to the world. The Two Witnesses are said to have power to shut up heaven so that it cease from raining during the time of their prophetic fulfillment, an allusion to the prophecies spoken by Elijah, the prophet of God and confirmed by its past and present fulfillment. The Witnesses are also said to be able to turn the water to blood and smite the earth, a work committed to Moses in the time of the Egyptian exodus, the "giver" of the Law. The Two Witness therefore are said to be made up of the Law and the Prophets, typified in the ministries of Moses and Elijah who visited Christ, giving their endorsement upon His work upon the Mount of Transfiguration (Luke 24:27). All prophetic revelations will meet their fulfillment in their appointed time as conveyed by God's Two Witnesses. (1 Kings 17:1; James 5:17; Amos 8:11; Matthew 13:52; Zech 4:14; Rev 11:3, 4; 12:1). [see Law and the Prophets (The); Keys of the Kingdom]
|||Tyrus||An ancient affluent coastal city of Syria with silver as dust and gold as the mire of the street that was the hub for commerce, selling and trading. All the merchants of the world did their bidding and trading in Tyrus until Nebuchadnezzar, King of the North, made the city desolate (Ezekiel 30:18-20; Zechariah 9:3, 4). As a hireling of the Lord, Nebuchadnezzar would scrape the city of Tyrus like the top of a stone and cast it into the sea, a fulfillment of the prophecy given by the prophet Ezekiel (Ezekiel 26:1-14; 29:18-20; Zechariah 9:3, 4). Tyrus offers a foreshadowing of the affluence and pride of the Papacy who bought, sold, and enriched itself with/by the merchants of the world, the Ships of Tarshish. But Tyrus also foreshadows the utter destruction of the once proud and terrible city, Spiritual Babylon (Isaiah 23; Ezekiel 26, 27; Matthew 11:20, 21). [see Ships of Tarshish; Tyrus (King of); Tyrus (Prince of); Zidon; King of the North; Great City]
|||Tyrus (Prince of)||A prophetic allusion to the Papacy, who is a man but sits in the seat of God over the seas (people), and whose heart is lifted up as a god. He enriches himself through his wisdom and propaganda and his heart is lifted up in pride. The fate of the Prince of Tyrus is to die the deaths of the uncircumcised. (Ezekiel 28:1-10) [see Shepherd (Idol)]
|||Tyrus (King of)||A prophetic allusion to Lucifer/the Devil, who was once a magnificent and exalted angel but has been cast out because of his pride. The fate of the King of Tyrus is eternal fires that cannot be quenched. (Ezekiel 28:11-19)
|||Ulai/Euphrates||River by which Daniel is taken in vision chronicling the rise and fall of nations leading up to the Abomination that Makes Desolate and finally Christ's work of cleansing the Most Holy Place in the heavenly temple (Daniel 8:2, 16). Jesus stands upon the River Ulai while Gabriel is commanded to reveal the prophecies to Daniel relating to Jesus' work in the Most Holy Place and events at the time of the end. Symbolically the river Ulai, whose source is the land from which the King of the North comes, flows into the Lake of Fire. [compare Hiddekel/Tigris]
|||Unrighteous Decree||Workings of Satan made manifest through the acts of rebellious and God forsaking men whose ultimate goal is to block the fulfillment of the Everlasting Covenant spoken in Genesis 3:15. The judgments of men that cause oppression, persecution, injustice and in time bring about death to the people of God, the poor (in spirit) and the meek:
1. The unrighteous decree of the king of Egypt to the Hebrew midwives to kill all male children at their birth (Exodus 1:15-22)
2. Saul's vain, presumptuous, and unrighteous death decree that any soldier who eats or tastes food while in the heat of battle should die (1 Samuel 14:23-52)
3. The unrighteous decrees of the leadership of Israel that oppressed the poor, the widows and the meek among God's people (Isaiah 10:1, 2)
4. Nebuchadnezzar's unrighteous decree in contempt against the God of heaven and the three Hebrew boys (Daniel 3:4-7)
5. The deceptive confederacy/conspiracy of the princes, counselors, captains, governors and presidents of the Medes & Persians against Daniel during the time of Darius I (Daniel 6:5-15)
6. Haman against the Jews during the time of Esther and Ahasuerus, the Persian King (Esther 3:8-13)
7. Herod against all male children under the age of two, seeking to kill Jesus, the rival King (Revelation 12:3, 4; Matthew 2)
8. A foreshadowing of the unrighteous decree that will break forth upon the last day people of God who are undesired by the world, who have been gathered by God, and who will ultimately be spared in the day of God's wrath (Zephaniah 2:1, 2; Revelation 13:11-17)

The examples of unrighteous decrees all foreshadow the workings of Satan in the last days with the issuing of the Image to the Beast. The Lord has promised to sustain His people, who have hidden themselves under the shadow of the Almighty during the perilous times marked by the decree and to turn the evil workings of men back upon those who make the commands (Psalm 91; Isaiah 10:3, 4) [see Image to the Beast; Confederate/Confederacy; ]
|||Untempered Mortar||untried, unproven, deceptive lies and untruths spoken by false prophets that proclaim peace and safety when there is neither peace nor safety. These words form a wall of deceptive protection for the unlearned and those with itching ears who desire to hear untruths rather than the corrections of the Lord. The wall of deceit and those who trust in it will be cast down by an overflowing shower from the Lord in the day of His vengeance (Ezekiel 13:10-16, 22:28). [see "Peace and Safety"; Watchmen (Blind/False), ? Wall (The)]
|||Veil||That which covers or obscures. All men are under a covering overcast of sin, death, and darkness which the Lord Himself will remove (Isaiah 25:8, 9; 60:1-5). Yet, as men persist in sin, and false worship the veil remains (2 Corinthians 4:1-4). 2The thick curtain of finely woven linen with blue, purple, and scarlet thread separating the two apartments of the Tabernacle, the Holy and Most Holy Place (Exodus 26:31-33). The veil protected the High Priest from instant death because it concealed the holiness and presence of God. Daily, the veil would be "contaminated" with the sins of the people by the sprinkling of blood, shed for sin. Christ in a literal sense, veiled His own divinity with humanity (Philippians 2:5-11) in order to become the atonement and High Priest of the human race. Christ bore our sins to the cross where he was rent (torn) for the entire human race. The rending of the veil of the earthly sanctuary at Christ's death on the cross was symbolic of the consummation of the ceremonial system under the Law of Moses. The shadows and types of the earthly sanctuary were to be shortly replaced with Christ's ministry as High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, made without man's hands (Hebrews 9:1-15)
|||Vessels of Gold and Silver||Those in the House of God that receive honor for their faith, godliness, and righteousness that they receive from the Lord. Gold and silver are purified (of sin) in the fires and made honorable, to be presented as jewels before the Lord and to be used to his glory. Their works shall ultimately stand in the day of reckoning (2 Timothy 2:19-21; Malachi 3:2-4, 17; 1 Corinthians 3:9-15). [see Wheat; ? Vessels of Wood and Earth, ? Tares]
|||Vessels of Wood and Earth||Those in the House of God whose works shall not stand in the Day of the Lord, but with their works will be shaken and be made stubble in the fires (Hebrews 12: 25-28; Malachi 4:1-3). The workers of iniquity who through neglect, pride and vanity persist in thinking on things of the world and not on things above and are deceived and eventually overthrown (1 Timothy 2:19-21). [see Tares; ? Vessels of Gold and Silver, ? Wheat]
|||Vine (of the Earth/Uncultivated/Wild/Empty)||Produces the unfruitful works of darkness (Eph 5:11, 12; Hosea 9:10, 10:1); those who reject God's grace/mercy and kingdom and will be trampled in God's winepress (2nd Death) (Rev 14:19, 20; Isaiah 63:2, 3) [see Tares; Wrath of God; ?True Vine; ? Vineyard (of the Lord)]
|||Vine (True)||Jesus Christ whose branches (the saints) bear much fruit of righteousness (John 15:1-8)
|||Vines, Fig Trees and Olives||A symbol of peaceful living with an abundance of God's blessings in the Promised Land (1 Kings 4:25, Micah 4:4; Zechariah 3:10)
|||Vineyard (of the Lord)||The house of Israel and Judah, but spiritually, the Remnant Church at the end of the world that will be partakers of the first reaping of the earth (Isaiah 5:1-7; 27:2, 3; Revelation 14:14-16, 20:4-6). [see Wheat]
|||Violence to the Law (to do)||To break the law; pervert or corrupt the law (Zephaniah 3:4)
|||Vision (mar'eh: Hebrew)||word used in Daniel 8, 9, 10 when given reference to the specific vision related to Christ in the Most Holy Place of the sanctuary (qodesh: Hebrew), performing the work of judgment. It is this vision of God in His Holiness performing the work of judgment that caused the prophets of old to fall to the ground lifeless, in shame, confessing their unworthiness and seeing their need of a Savior. With this realization and outpouring of humility and selflessness, God in turn blots out their sins and declares them righteous, ready to be used of Him. The mar'eh vision produces the fruit of righteousness by faith which is our justification with God (Exodus 34:5-9; Isaiah 6:1-8; Jeremiah 4:3, 4; Daniel 10:4-12; Revelation 1:10-18; )
|||Vision (chazown: Hebrew)||Word used in Daniel 8, 10 when given reference to the entire panoramic vision tracing the rise and fall of world kingdoms. The chazown vision is that which foretells and forewarns the people of things to come that is a safeguard to those who hear, understand, and heed its counsels. It is the refusal of this vision (knowledge) for which the people perish (Proverbs 29:18; Hosea 4:4-6).
|||Vision (Open)||A manifestation of the power of God where He, through His Holy Spirit imparts a prophetic word/message visibly seen in the life of a prophet. The visions are often accompanied by supernatural manifestations including the cessation of breathing by the prophet, superhuman strength, utterances under the inspiration of God, etc. (Numbers 24:4). Open Visions were often withheld by the LORD when His people were in open rebellion or the gift of prophecy was held in scorn. (1 Samuel 3:1)
|||Vomit||Backsliding in faith (Isaiah 28:7, 8; 2 Peter 2:20-22)
|||Wall (The)||The Law of God. That which is a shield and defense while you abide within them, but apostasy causes the walls to be torn down, bringing reproach (1 Samuel 25:16; 1 Kings 3:1; 2 Chronicles 36:19, Proverbs 24:31-34; Isaiah 5:1-5; Nehemiah 2:17). God's Law was to surround the people of God who dwell within them so that their sacrifices and offerings would be pleasing in His sight (Psalm 51:18, 19). The wall (Law) is that which crushes the foolish/wicked/lawless who pisses against it (1 Samuel 25:22, 34; Deuteronomy 22:22-24; 2 Kings 9:8; Isaiah 25:4). When the Law (walls) of God are being rebuilt, the breaches in the wall are being repaired and a threefold union arises to come against the work (Nehemiah 4:1, 6-8; Isaiah 58:12; Ezra 5:3; Nehemiah 4, 6:1-15; Daniel 9:25). False Prophets seek to build a wall of defense themselves and not the wall of the Lord, using untempered mortar. God promises to send an overflowing rain and storm upon the wall of defense and those who build it so that they may be laid waste and the builders are destroyed (Ezekiel 13:8-16) [see Streets; Troublous Times; Pisseth against the Wall; ? untempered mortar]
|||Watch (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4 th)||Three hour period of sentinel watches commencing at 6:00PM and extending through the following morning. The followers of Christ are often reminded by Him to watch and be ready, or stand as a sentinel guard, awaiting the Second Coming of Christ (Luke 12:36-40; Matthew 24:42, 27:65, 66).
|||Watcher(s)||God Himself, who stands watch over His people and over all the works of men on the earth. The Lord is often accompanied by a Recording Angel who takes note of the works of men and write them in the books of record. 2Those who behold and can give credible testimony for or against the works of men. Those who declare judgment and justice for wrongs done. (Daniel 4:9, 13, 12:1; Proverbs 5:21, 15:3; Ezekiel 9:1-5; Isaiah 41:27, 28; Jeremiah 4:16, 17; Malachi 3:14-16; Matthew 18:10, 25:31)
|||Watchmen||Those who stand on the Wall of the Lord, the Word of God; those who "cry aloud, spare not, and show God's people their transgressions" (Isaiah 58:1). those who have heard the message of truth and warning from the Lord, have eaten God's prophetic book/scroll and have responded by walking in the former Ways and Old Paths. These faithful ones Sigh & Cry at the wickedness of the foolish. God has appointed them to be watchmen, or centuries to His people as they sound the trumpets that gather the people to the truth and light the paths of righteousness. The watchmen sees and understands all the events associated with the sounding of the 1st and 2nd Angel's messages that are repeated in the last days before the coming of Christ, and crying like a lion, they teach the people to observe these things (Isaiah 21:7-12). These watchmen see eye-to-eye in unity and their tidings (message) are salvific in nature as they warn of the coming of the king of the North (Isaiah 52:7, 8). However, strong warning is given to the watchmen who choose not to sound the warning-cry, specifically, that the blood of the lost will be on their hands. (1 Samuel 18:24-27; Proverbs 24:11, 12; Jeremiah 6:17; Ezekiel 2:8-10, 3:1-21; 33:1-9; Habakkuk 2:1-4; Acts 18:5, 6; 20:25-28). [see Wall (The); Ways and Old Paths, Sigh & Cry, Early Writings Chpt13 - The Messengers; Chpt 18 - The Gathering Time by EGW]
|||Watchmen (Blind/False)||Shepherds with no understanding; greedy dogs who look their own way and who cannot be filled, seeking their own gain; they are drunken with wine and strong drink and think that their revelry will have no end. These watchmen bear a false message of "peace and safety" when there is no peace nor safety. God gathers the beast of the field to consume the Blind Watchmen (Isaiah 56:9-12; Jeremiah 2:7, 8, 26, 5:5, 6, 12, 13, 26-28, 31, 14:13-16, 18, 28:10-17; Ezekiel 13:1- 3; Amos 7:10-13; Micah 2:11). [see Head and Tail, Branch and Rush; Drunkards of Ephraim; "Peace and Safety"; Untempered Mortar; Briers and Thorns; Wine (Old)]
|||Water||Doctrine, the word of God (Deuteronomy 32:2). [see Bread (corn/grain); Fountain for Sin and Uncleanness]
|||Water (of life)||The Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Christ (Judges 6:36-40; John 4:14, 7:37-39; Psalm 23:2; Proverbs 18:4; Isa 41:17; 44:3; 55:1; Jeremiah 2:13; Joel 2:23-28; Zech 13:1; Rev 22:17) [see Latter Rain, Former Rain, Times of Refreshing; Fountain for Sin and Uncleanness]
|||Waters||Peoples, nations, multitudes; a densely populated area (Rev 17:15, 19:6; Daniel 7:3; Isaiah 8:5-8; 17:12, 13; 60:5; Ecclesiastes 11:1) [see Seas] 
|||Wave Loaves||Two loaves of bread containing leaven (symbol for sin) used during the Feast of Weeks whose antitype is Pentecost, where the outpouring of the Holy Spirit was manifested. The end time antitype is the 144,000 who receive the Holy Spirit (Latter Rain) and are sealed with the seal of God at the end of time. Firstfruits (of the living) who are born in the world with sin but with the sanctification of the Holy Spirit (fire), their sins are thoroughly baked out. They are to be lifted up (waved) before the world (Lev 23:16, 17; Zechariah 9:16) at the passing of the Sunday Law as the reason for the destruction befalling the earth according to the wicked, but as a light to the Gentiles for those being saved. [see Ensign, Firstfruit, Number #144,000]. 
|||Wax (to)||To grow or increase progressively as in "the love of many will wax cold" (Matthew 24:12), the little horn "waxed great" (Daniel 8:10).
|||Waymark||A signpost or indicator for the traveler that they are on course. The prophetic sequences of events given in the Bible are to be waymarks for the Christian pilgrims, indicating approximate time and course for those traveling to the Promised Land (Jeremiah 31:21); the Babylonian captivity was a waymark in the first advent of Christ (Matthew 1:17, Daniel 9:25, Jeremiah 23:5-8).
|||Ways and Old Paths (Walk ye in the)||The gospel truths of former days spoken by the prophets of old that have been obscured, abandoned for falsehood, traditions, smooth speaking, and deceits (Jeremiah 18:15; Isaiah 30:10, 11; Zechariah 7:11-13). God promises in returning to the former ways and old paths we will find rest for our souls and will be saved (Jeremiah 6:16; Isaiah 58:12). It is this message, delivered by angels (3 Angel's message) that will divide the church into wheat and tares. [see Path of the Just / Paths to Dwell in/ Old Paths; Loud Cry; ? Seals (seven)]
|||Weaned from the Milk and Drawn from the Breast||Those who are not babes in Christ and His doctrines but mature; those who will receive End Time knowledge and will stand as the wise/teachers; those who will not perish due to a lack of knowledge (Isaiah 28:9; Daniel 12:3, 10; Hebrews 5:12-6:3; Hosea 4:6). [see Wise (the); Seven Thunders]
|||Weeping/Wailing and Gnashing||The response of the foolish and wicked upon realizing the results of their spurning the gracious salvation offered by Jesus Christ. Those who reject Jesus as Messiah due to a lack of faith and obedience will regret with ungodly sorrow. (Matthew 8:11, 12, 22:13, 24:48-51, 25:26-30; 2 Corinthians 7:10) [see Foolish (the), Tares, ? Sigh & Cry] 
|||Weighed in the Balances||To be evaluated and judged (Ezekiel 5:1, 2; Daniel 5:27)
|||Wheat||The good seed sown by the Sower. The Children of the Kingdom of God who bring forth food for the earth. They must grow in the midst of tares and attempt to provide a transforming influence to those around them. These will be gathered at the end of the world by the gatherers (Angels) and brought to God's heavenly home (Matthew 13:23-30, 36-43; Acts 10:34, 35). [see Trees of Righteousness, Remnant, Saints, Vessels of Gold and Silver; Cattle (fat/lean); Dead (to sin), Three Angels' Message, Harvest/Reap, Vineyard (of the Lord), Rebuilding the Alter of the Lord ? Tares]
|||Wheels within Wheels||Symbolically, the portrayal of the parallel lines of prophecy (line upon line, precept upon precept) throughout the Bible that upon first glance are difficult to read and understand, but with study and the empowering of the Holy Spirit, reveal consistent lines of truth stretching from eternity past to eternity future. The hands portrayed above the wheels that control their movement show God's control over all world events, no matter how complex or complicated they appear. His divine purposes and will, revealed summarily through the Bible, are what ultimately determine the outcomes. (Ezekiel 1:15-21, 10:9-13; Isaiah 28:10-13; 1 Corinthians 2:12, 13; Prophets and Kings pg 535)
|||White||Purity, cleanness, freedom, truth, victory, the priesthood (Rev 12:1, Rev 4:4, 6:9-11, 7:9)
|||White Robes (Raiment)||God's Character, Christ's Righteousness (Rev 3:18, Matt 22:10-14) imputed to the redeemed; clothing worn by the inhabitants or those who will inhabit heaven; "purity of soul, character cleansed from sin by the atoning blood of the Savior" (Matthew 17:2, 28:3; Luke 9:29; Revelation 3:5; 1T 51.2).
|||Whore/Harlot||A church (see Woman) that has lost her first love for Christ and commits fornication [adultery - allegiance is not to God but man/self/wealth/riches/power] with others [kings and merchants of the earth] (Rev 18:3, 9-13)
|||Wild (Man)||A statement made in reference to Ishmael, the son of Abram born to Hagar that means the "wild ass" (Genesis 16:21; Job 24:5; Isaiah 32:14, 15). [see Wilderness2, Horse (Wild Arabian)]
|||Wild Arabian Ass||[see Horse (Wild Arabian); Kedar (sons of)]
|||Wilderness||1. Secrecy, seclusion, place of refuge: true church fled into wilderness for 1260yr time of Papal reign (538AD-1798) (Rev 12:6, 14; 17:3);
2. A barren land of desolation where Ishmael and his descendants dwell; the Arabian desert (Genesis 21:21). [see Horse (Wild Arabian)]
|||Wind||1. The operation of God's Holy Spirit (John 3:5-8; Ezekiel 37:1-10)
2. Groundless doctrine; doctrine of men (Mark 7:7; Ephesians 4:14)
3. Sin, iniquity and unrighteousness (Isaiah 64:6; Matthew 7:25)
4. Winds and whirlwinds of judgment and enemies, which begins, according to the prophet Ezekiel, with first, the sword; second, the famine; third, the noisome beasts; fourth, the pestilence. 14:21. (A Seal of the Living God, pg 15.1, Joseph Bates)
|||Winds, Trumpets||War, strife, turmoil- political, social, economic, religious (Jeremiah 49:36, 37)
|||Winds (four)||The earth, four directions of the compass (Jeremiah 49:36; Matthew 24:31; Isaiah 11:12)
|||Winds (holding the four); Rough Winds||The restraining work of four angels who for a time contain the sword, mass calamity that is to befall the earth after God's Investigative Judgment in heaven has finished, probation closed for the world, and the "servants of God" are sealed with their Father's name on their foreheads (Revelation 7:1-8; Jeremiah 25:32, 33). Angels are symbolically holding back these winds from the four directions of the compass, symbolizing God's grace and restraint He places upon the Earth by the presence of the Holy Spirit during this time of sealing. A prophetic allusion to the restraint placed on Islam, the distress of nations (Luke 21:25), on August 11, 1840 by the 4 Great European powers. Islam is characterized as wild horses (asses) looking to break-loose upon the earth. At the end of time, this history is repeated after September 11, 2001 when the Rough Winds are restrained while Islam, the East Wind, is blowing (Isaiah 27:8). All the while, the Spiritual Wind, or Holy Spirit is being poured out upon the 144,000 who are receiving the Latter Rain, giving life to a people once dead (Laodicea) in their spiritual condition (Ezekiel 37:9, 10). When Christ ends His ministration in the Most Holy Place, the sealing would have completed, the restraints will be let loose, and God's Holy Spirit would be withdrawn from the earth so that God, through the Spirit no longer makes intercession with groaning for men, and men's hearts and minds have been sealed, either for or against God (Revelation 22:11). The releasing of the four winds, or God's Rough Winds will be prompted by some dastardly deed of Islam, the East Wind, that will anger the nations (Rev 11:18, 9:4, 22:11) [see Rough Wind, Investigative Judgment, Time of Trouble, Number #4, Horse (Wild Arabian), Children of the East, East Wind]
|||Wine||doctrines, teachings, a message [see Milk] (Isaiah 28:7-9; 55:1-3; Matthew 9:10-17; Acts 17:16-21).
|||Wine (New)||Unfermented grape juice wherein lies a blessing (Deuteronomy 33:28; Isaiah 65:8; John 2:3-10; Luke 5:37). True, righteous teachings as given by Jesus Christ; teachings not contaminated (fermented) with the doctrines of men, but the pure wine from the True Vine (John 15:1-8; Deuteronomy 32:14). Jesus' blood, of which we are to drink is symbolized by the New Wine (John 6:53-63). Those who receive the seal of God would have drunk of the New Wine of Christ, whereas the wicked will be drunk with the wine of fornication. [see Garments (whitened)/ (New), ? Old Bottles/Garments, Naked]
|||Wine (Old)||Fermented grape juice that intoxicates and is to be avoided (Proverbs 23:29-35). Teachings tainted with men's dogmas/ doctrine (fermentation) rather than the pure Word of God. Jesus says "... no one, having drunk old wine, immediately desires new, for he says 'the old is better'" (Luke 5:39). Those who drink of Old Wine become babblers and err in judgment (Daniel 5:1-5). The House of Israel & Judah (Adventism) is likened to those who bring forth wild grapes and cannot receive the rains (Latter Rains) because the Lord will withhold them in "that day" of woe (Isaiah 5:1-8). [see Leaven; Drunk (to be); Babbler; Garments (filthy rags)/(Old); Babylon; Wine (or Wrath) of Fornication]
|||Wine (or Wrath) of Fornication||Last day deceptions made widespread through the adulterous union of church and state, causing men to stumble away from God and receive the Mark of the Beast. The wine that the merchants of the earth drink from the whore, Babylon, including: Sunday sacredness, the immortality of the soul breeding Spiritualism and the manifestation of signs and lying wonders, and denying the divinity of Christ. Martin Luther, the Reformer once wrote of these heresies and others to be part of "numberless prodigies of the Romish dunghill of decretals." (Deuteronomy 32:32, 33; Mark 7:7; Rev 14:8, 17:2; 18:3, 23). [see Fornication]
|||Winepress of the Lord||Symbol of God's restitution and judgment upon the wicked where they are gathered as grapes, judged and then pressed in God's winepress. They caused God's people to drink fermented wine and they will become such (Joel 3:12, 13; Revelation 14:14-20)
|||Wings||Speed; swiftness; quickness in battle (Habakkuk 1:6-8, Dan 7:4, 6)
|||Wise (the)||"The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do [his commandments]: his praise endureth for ever." (Psalm 111:10) Those who keep the commandments of God, hear and do the sayings of Jesus Christ; those who build their house on the Rock, Jesus Christ, a sure foundation [house] (Matthew 7:24, 25); those who take sufficient and an overflowing of oil for their lamps, keeping their lamps trimmed and burning until the coming of the bridegroom (Matthew 25:1-13); Those who receive the glad tidings of Jesus and the counsels of His prophets as Honey for Sweetness and are teachers of righteousness, winning souls to the Kingdom (Proverbs 1:2-7, 11:30, 16:21; Jeremiah 15:16); Those who as teachers, shine as an ensign to the world, having understanding of last day events and turn many sons to righteousness (Daniel 11:33, 35; 12:3, 10; Matthew 13:24-30, 37-43; ? Hebrews 5:12); those who teach the truths of the gospel of God until Christ comes again (Matthew 24:45, 46); those faithful servants who feed their household with solid food, not milk, until the coming of their Master (Matthew 24:45-47); those who invest their wealth/talents/gifts/opportunities for the service of the Kingdom of God (Matthew 24:14-17, 20-23) [see Children of the Day/Light; Ensign; Watchmen; Wheat; Honey for Sweetness; Oil (for lamps); Sigh & Cry; Weaned from the Milk and Drawn from the Breast; ? Foolish (the)/Wicked (the)]
|||Wise (Wisdom) of this World||A prophetic revelation of the hearts and condition of men who, being led by a reprobate mind and governed through a spirit of self-exaltation and infidelity, deny God and the Knowledge of His Sovereignty. "This wisdom descendeth not from above, but [is] earthly, sensual, devilish" (James 3:15). Christ said that the sons of this world are more shrewd than the sons of light [God] and appear wise in their deceptive and crafty dealings, yet the Lord counsels the wise of the world to become fools so that they may be truly wise and learn the wisdom of God. (Luke 16:1-8; 1 Corinthians 1:18-21, 3:18-21; 2 Corinthians 12:16). [see Seed of the serpent; Craft, Subtle]
|||Without Hands||That which is done without the might, nor power of man, but rather by the Spirit of God. A feat accomplished outside the realm of human control or capability but only by God (Daniel 2:34, 45; Zechariah 4:6; Mark 14:58; Colossians 2:11).
|||Woes (three)||Expressions of grief, fear, anguish and dismay, written on a scroll for Ezekiel to eat (Ezekiel 2:9-3:1). The eating of the woeful message signifies that he has taken in this experience for himself and is called to then be a watchman for the rebellious House of Israel; 2Last of three judgments of God typified by the final three sounding trumpets of seven trumpets mentioned in Revelation 8, 9, and 11, all of which involve Islam as a scourge against the apostate religious system, Babylon, and her offspring, Apostate Protestantism (Genesis 16:11, 12) [see Bitter/Sweet; Watchmen; Day of the Lord]
  1. The first Woe (Revelation 9:1-12) starting after the sounding of the 5th trumpet which commenced in 628AD, highlights the rise of Islam described as locusts, a scourge to the earth, but not to the trees and grass as the locusts of Egypt but rather to those who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads (Revelation 9:4). Arising from the Bottomless Pit, a symbol of emptiness and desolation, aptly characteristic of the region of Arabia from which it came, Islam is clearly noted by the following distinctive characteristics:
    a. Islam's leader, characterized by a Star fallen from heaven and unlocking the bottomless pit, Mohammed founded the religion around 612AD. As smoke of the bottomless pit arises it covers the Sun (of Righteousness), the influence of Christ and Christianity, and darkens the air for all the lands that come under its control. [see Sun]
    b. Arising from the smoke are locusts that under the right conditions can come forth in swarms of hundreds of millions and can over-run a land of vegetation and spread out for hundreds of miles. The imagery of locusts is appropriate for the spread of Islam under Mohammed that by 632AD had united the Arabian Peninsula under its banner. Within 100 years, in 732AD, Islam had nearly over-run the world and subdue Western Europe had it not been checked at the Battle of Tours in France.
    c. Having a regard, reverence, and concern for nature as the creation of God and as something to be used of men but respected, this power is commanded "them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree". The grass, tree, and green things are symbols of commandment-keeping people, both Christian and Jews who preserved the true biblical faith, who were spared the destruction of Islamic forces provided they agree to pay tribute.
    d. Arising from a disdain for the hypocrisy exhibited by the professed followers of Christ in the Church of Rome who neither knew nor adhered to Christ's teachings (Revelation 9:20, 21), Islam waged war against and sought to torment those of the Roman Empire centered in Constantinople "which have not the seal of God in their foreheads"
    e. The locusts torment for 5 prophetic months or 150 literal years (Revelation 9:5). Commencing on July 27, 1299, the commencement of the 1st Woe, in the Battle of Bapheum (Nicomedium), the Turkish Muslims began persistent assaults on the Eastern Roman Empire. On July 27, 1449, 150 years later the Eastern Roman, or Byzantine Empire, became a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. This is confirmed as Constantine XI seeks the permission and backing of the Ottoman Empire to outmaneuver other claimants to the throne, so as to become emperor.
    f. Described as men having long hair as women, and having crowns upon their heads, Arab men are forbidden to shave their heads and wear turbans to conceal their hair. Compared to locusts, they are further described as armies of horses prepared to battle whose sound are "as chariots of many horses running to battle" (Joel 2:2-11). Arabians were known for their skillfulness in horse riding and mounted armies. [see Horse (Wild Arabian Ass)]
  2. The Second Woe, coincident with the sounding of the sixth trumpet (Revelation 9:13-21; 11:14), commenced on July 27, 1449 and extending for 391 years 15 days until August 11, 1840, denotes the time of the Ottoman Empire's assault against Papal dominated Europe. These forces in truth benefited the Protestant movement as it served as a distraction for the Papal Army's persecution and in many instances held Papal attacks upon Protestants in check, allowing the movement to flourish. That Islam is being spoken of in these verses is again confirmed by the following facts:
    a. The four angels bound in the river Euphrates can be viewed as the four sultans of the Turkish Ottoman Empire: Aleppo, Iconium, Damascus and Baghdad, four destructive forces that moved upon the western world.
    b. The swift moving cavalry of the Ottoman Empire appeared so innumerable that it was likened to 200million. The colors of fire (red), jacinth (blue), and brimstone (yellow) were common colors of the Turkish uniforms. The fire and brimstone, typically denoting judgment, that proceed from the mouth of the lion-like horses speak of the ferocity in battle and the use of gunpowder and firearms, introduced by the Arabs in warfare.
    c. May 1453AD, Constantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Turks under Mehmed II the Sultan who utilized guns and cannons [the "Basilica", created by Orban, a 27ft long cannon able to hurl a 600lb stone ball over 1 mile], new and unconventional weapons of warfare in the toppling of the city.
  Though the "woe" had ended by August 11, 1840 (Revelation 11:14) when the four Christian nations of Europe [England, Russia, Austria, Prussia - 4 corners of the earth (Isaiah 11:12; Revelation 7:1)] restrained the Egyptian militant uprising of Islam by Mehtmat Ali, the sixth trumpet continued to sound until the commencement of the 7th trumpet on October 22, 1844.
  3. The Third Woe (Revelation 11:14, 15), using the principle of the Triple Application of Prophecy (1 + 2 = 3), must in some way also involve the works of the scourge, Islam. Further, looking at the pattern of the commencement and conclusion of the 1st and 2nd Woes relative to the 5th and 6th trumpets, we see a staggered start of the 1st Woe relative to the 5th trumpet and a preliminary ending of the 2nd Woe relative to the 6th trumpet. Therefore, following the pattern established, the third and final Woe must have a staggered start to the seventh trumpet and must conclude prior to the ending of the seventh trumpet. The coming of this Woe is said to come quickly after the events of the 2nd Woe. However the sounding of the seventh trumpet is said to be comprised of a period of time marked by the following events:
    a. The temple of God being opened and the ark of God's covenant being visible to men (Revelation 11:19). A statement symbolizing Christ coming upon the clouds of heaven (Luke 21:27; Daniel 7:13, 14) moving from the Holy Place on October 21, 1844 into the Most Holy Place to commence the Investigative Judgment. [see Clouds, Investigative Judgment]
    b. The nations being angered, the coming of the wrath of God, and the judgment of the dead; all three separate and distinct events marking the end times.
      i. The "nations were angered" parallels the 2nd Woe where an act of Islam causes the world to be vexed with this scourge. The date September 11, 2001 marks the date that the nations were angered and a war was declared upon "radical Islam" as it waged war against the United States, the False Prophet and the enabler of the Beast Power. [see "Nations were Angry", East Wind]
      ii. The coming of the wrath of God (3rd Angel's Message) is soon to appear following the passage and enforcement of the Sunday Law, the Image to the Beast (Revelation 15, 18:4-24). [see Image to the Beast]
      iii. The judgment of the dead (3rd Angel's Message), the wicked who lie dead at the 2nd Coming of Christ and those who will be consumed by the brightness of His coming, will be judged by that which is written in the books before being thrown into the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:12-15). [see Lake of Fire]

The sounding of the seventh and final trumpet commenced on October 22, 1844 when the entrance to the Most Holy Place was visible by John the Revelator (Revelation 11:15, 19) and Christ entered into the 2nd apartment of the heavenly sanctuary to start the work of cleansing the sanctuary (Daniel 8:14). The events of the 7th trumpet extend to the judgment and destruction of the wicked after Christ's 3rd Coming to the earth. The third and final "woe" however, did not arrive until 157years later with the toppling of the twin towers on September 11, 2001 and the declaration of a Global war on Terrorism, radical Islam (Zephaniah 1:16; Isaiah 30:20-25, 32:14, 27:8, 9).

|||Woman||A Church (Jeremiah 3:14, 20, 6:2, 31:32; Isa 51:16; Hosea 2:16-20; Isa 54:5, 62:5)
|||Woman (Adulterous)||One who has a whores forehead, has forsaken the guide of her youth and has broken the covenant (Jeremiah 3:1-4; Proverbs 2:16, 17; 6:20-26). The Adulterous woman is worse than the harlot woman because the harlot works for hire whereas the Adulterous woman takes no pay (Ezekiel 16:30-34). A depiction of apostate Adventism whose works of rebellion against God's revealed truths are worse than the whore Babylon. Apostate Adventism has turned from the "guide of her youth", Jesus, depicted as the Rock of Ages in Adventism's early history (Hosea 2:14, 15; Exodus 13:17-22; 1 Corinthians 10:1-4). The Rock of Ages is likened to the truths portrayed on the 1843 and 1850 charts that Adventism has rejected.
|||Woman (Harlot Woman)||False Church that commits whoredom with the kings and merchants of the world. A reference to the Church of Rome, Babylon the Great, the Mother of harlots (Jeremiah 3:6; Ezek 23; Rev 17:3-6). [see Jezebel; Woman (Strange Woman)]
|||Woman (Pure Woman, A virgin)||The True Remnant Church (Rev 12:1, 11, 17; 2 Corinthians 11:2; Eph 5:22-32)
|||Woman (Strange Woman)||A harlot (Judges 11:1, 2). [see Woman (Harlot Woman)]
|||Woman's Glory||The Bible states that a woman's glory is her glory, yet Mary Magdalene washed Jesus' feet with her hair, showing complete humility.
|||Word of their testimony||The word of God, internalized, made personal, and lived out in the life of the redeemed who successfully overcome the attacks of the devil through Jesus Christ. The Bible describes those who will endure extreme trial of persecution and will be over comers by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. Just as Jesus demonstrated victory over Satan in the wilderness by the Word of God ["It is written..."], so we must hide the word of God in our hearts that we do not sin against Him, exercise the faith of Jesus Christ that overcomes the world, and allow God's written words to be our testimony (Revelation 12:11; Matthew 4:1-11; Psalm 119:9-16; 1 John 5:1-5). [see Overcome; Blood; Lamb of God]
|||Wormwood (a star called)||The boast of Attila the Hun was "the grass never grew where his horse had trod" signifying the complete and utter extirpation and destruction he left in his wake. "The scourge of his enemies, and fear of the world", Attila is the star "Wormwood" and territories he subdued became wormwood, complete erasure. This prophecy under the third trumpet of Revelation 8:10, 11 speaks of one who was active in bringing down and dividing the Western Pagan Roman Empire.
|||Wrath of God||All of God's hatred towards sin that Jesus was made to drink at Gethsemane and at the Cross to atone for the sins of the world. Those who in the last days receive the Mark of the Beast will have to drink of the cup of God's wrath themselves, embodied in the seven last plagues. The plagues will commence when Michael stands-up, ending the world's probation and ushering in a time of trouble. The wrath of God is prophetically preceded by the Nations were Angry and is followed by Time of the Dead (Job 19:11; Zechariah 7:9-12; Matt 26:39-42; Rev 11:18, 15:1, 14:9-11, 16:1). [see Cup (of God's wrath); Drink of the Cup]
|||Written on Tables and Noted in a Book||Prophetic allusion in the book of Habakkuk chapter 2:1-3 where God commands that the prophetic visions of world and last day events be noted on two tables, namely the prophetic chronological charts of 1843 by Charles Fitch and its revision, published in 1850. Just as God entered into covenant with Ancient Israel, where the congregation tarried for 46 years and God gave evidence of His covenant to the people with two tables of stone (Exodus 24:1-18). So too, the Advent Movement tarried while being built into God's spiritual church for 46 years and God confirmed His covenant with the two tables The two tables are the response of God's watchmen who stand and wait for the command of the Lord when he is reproved. (Isaiah 30:8, Habakkuk 2:1-4). The message of the tables causes two classes to appear, those who willingly embrace the truths "made plain" who then run and tell others of the message, and those with a rebellious heart reject the message, and in time reject Jesus Christ (Isaiah 30:9-11, Jeremiah 6:16, 17; Ezekiel 12:21-25, 27, 28; The Great Controversy pg 392; Early Writings - My First Vision pg 14, pg 74.1). [see Number #46, Tarrying Time; Early Writings 74; Great Controversy pg 391, 392]
|||Zidon (or Sidon)||A "great city" of Phoenicia, situated with the city of Tyrus along the Mediterranean for trade; it bordered the lands of Asher and that were as briers and thorns to the people of Israel, having seized some of the silver and gold from the temple of the Lord (Joel 3:4, 5). In their rebellion, the Children of Israel adopted the strange and foreign gods of Zidon, causing the anger of the Lord to be kindled against them. It is in this foreign land that the prophet Elijah sought haven from the King of Israel, Ahab and his wife Jezebel for three and a half years, being nourished by the woman of Zeraphath. This truth confirmed that God even has His people in some of the most despicable places (see also Matthew 15:21-28). God first promised to subdue Zidon by Nebuchadnezzar for 70 years but then He promised to utterly destroy Zidon that it should no longer be briers and thorns against His people. Yet, God teaches an object lesson in the life of Elijah, where the prophet forsakes the many cities of Israel to dwell during the time of famine under the apostate king Ahab and his wife Jezebel, and seeks refuge in Zidon, the same home of wicked Jezebel. Elijah is sent by the Lord to Zarephath of Zidon, to a Syro-Phoenician woman who accommodates the prophet and as a result, she and her household were preserved from the famine and saved into the Kingdom of God. This lesson teaches that in the most despicable places, God has His people who He will call forth from destruction. (Judges 1:31, 10:6; 1 Kings 17:9-24; Isaiah 23:1-12; Jeremiah 25:14-29, 27:1-7; Ezekiel 28:21-24; Matthew 11:21, 15:21-28; Luke 4:25, 26). [see Tyrus; Nineveh; Great City; Briers and Thorns; Elijah (Elias)]
|||Zion (Mt.)||Meaning "Sunny", a height (surpassing Mt. Moriah by 105feet) upon which Jerusalem is built. It was surrounded on all sides except the north by deep valleys. David took this hill from the Jebusites and built a palace on the hill which in time had come to be known as the "City of David" (Joshua 15:63; 2 Samuel 5:7; 1King 8:1; 2 Kings 19:21, 31). 1A name used to denote the city of Jerusalem in general (Psalm 87:2, 149:2; Isaiah 33:14). 2A reference to the people of God, His chosen seed who represent the descendents of Isaac who are born of promise (Psalm 51:18, 87:5; Galatians 4:21-31). 3A reference to the church of God (Hebrews 12:22). 4A reference to the heavenly city. Those who come to Jesus are said to come to Mt. Zion where God, the angels, the saints made perfect and Jesus, the Mediator of the New Covenant dwell (Hebrews 12:22-24; Revelation 14:1). [see Jerusalem; Mountain (Glorious Holy or Great)]
