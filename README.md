During the ages the controversy between Jesus and Satan is portrayed in the Word of God a battle between good and eval. Satan trying to dethrone God, and God displaying to His whole kingdom the result of transgressing His law.

Satan, knowing the ways of his eval, knowing that his time is short, try by force to destroy Gods people, and thereby inflicting as much harm and sorrow to Jesus, and his people.

God always open and truth full, where Satan always working in the dark and behind the scene. For this reason, Jesus warned that we should take heed that no one deceives us.

In the beginning God said to Adam, if you eat of the fruit of this tree you will die (Gen 2: 16-17). Satan told Eve, you will surely not die, but your eyes will open, knowing good from eval, and become like gods (Gen 3: 4-5).

This lie of Satan is believed today, churches preach that if you die you go to heaven, they preach an eternal fire, that will consume the wicket for ever and ever.

I lost plenty of dear friends in my live. Some were very young, and for what reason should they spend an eternity in the fires of hell as these people preach.

These teachings are not Biblically correct. God in his grace, send His Son, to free us from sin, but the wicket will be consumed, and die. They will not burn forever.

With studies and links to follow as this project takes form, scriptures will be highlighted so that you can read it for yourself.

No dogma, just scripture. Though some text needs explaining, like the word ‘hell’ that occurs in the old testament 65 times, in the Hebrew, was translated half the time as ‘Death’ and the other half as ‘Hell’. There for no perceptions will be allowed in the studies.
